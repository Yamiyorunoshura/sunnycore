sections:
  - id: project_info
    title: Project Info
    instruction: |
      Summarize the initiative with short, scannable bullets.
      Include name, mission, primary stakeholders, current status, and key timelines.
      Cite the exact files (architecture, requirements, README) for every fact.

  - id: tech_stack
    title: Tech Stack
    instruction: |
      Enumerate languages, frameworks, runtimes/hosting, supporting tools or services, and data stores.
      Highlight mandatory versions or deployment constraints sourced from manifests or architecture docs.
      Use TODO bullets for unknown layers that require human clarification.

  - id: key_architecture
    title: Key Architecture
    instruction: |
      Describe the system shape: core modules, data flow, integrations, and deployment topology.
      Capture operational concerns (scaling, reliability, security) noted in architecture or ops runbooks.
      Keep bullets concise; prefer one integration or component per bullet with citations.

  - id: coding_standard
    title: Coding Standard
    instruction: |
      List style guides, lint/test requirements, branching & review workflow, and documentation expectations.
      Pull details from standards docs, CONTRIBUTING guides, or task-specific governance notes.
      Flag discrepancies between sources as TODO items instead of guessing resolutions.
      
      **Format:**
      - **Style Guide:** {language/framework style guide} - {source file}
      - **Linting:** {lint tool and rules} - {configuration location}
      - **Testing:** {test requirements and coverage thresholds} - {source}
      - **Documentation:** {documentation standards} - {source}

  - id: development_workflow
    title: Development Workflow
    instruction: |
      Document the development process and workflow standards:
      
      **Task Execution:**
      - Task selection and planning process
      - Development approach (TDD, BDD, etc.)
      - Code review requirements
      - Testing strategies
      
      **Version Control:**
      - Branching strategy
      - Commit message standards
      - Pull request process
      - Merge requirements
      
      **Quality Gates:**
      - Definition of Done criteria
      - Review acceptance criteria
      - Deployment gates
      
      Source each point to relevant documentation or mark as TODO.

  - id: quality_standards
    title: Quality Standards
    instruction: |
      Define quality standards and acceptance criteria:
      
      **Code Quality:**
      - Code review standards and scoring dimensions
      - Test coverage requirements (e.g., ≥80%)
      - Performance benchmarks
      - Security requirements
      
      **Documentation Quality:**
      - Required documentation types
      - Documentation standards
      - Knowledge management approach
      
      **Review Process:**
      - Review scoring methodology
      - Acceptance/rejection criteria
      - Risk assessment guidelines
      
      Reference review templates and quality guidelines from project documentation.

checks:
