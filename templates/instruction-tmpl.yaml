  name: Project Instruction Blueprint
  version: 1.0
  output:
    format: markdown
    headings_order:
      - Project Info
      - Tech Stack
      - Key Architecture
      - Coding Standard
    citation_policy: "Each bullet must reference its source file or be marked TODO."

sections:
  - id: project_info
    title: Project Info
    instruction: |
      Summarize the initiative with short, scannable bullets.
      Include name, mission, primary stakeholders, current status, and key timelines.
      Cite the exact files (architecture, requirements, README) for every fact.

  - id: tech_stack
    title: Tech Stack
    instruction: |
      Enumerate languages, frameworks, runtimes/hosting, supporting tools or services, and data stores.
      Highlight mandatory versions or deployment constraints sourced from manifests or architecture docs.
      Use TODO bullets for unknown layers that require human clarification.

  - id: key_architecture
    title: Key Architecture
    instruction: |
      Describe the system shape: core modules, data flow, integrations, and deployment topology.
      Capture operational concerns (scaling, reliability, security) noted in architecture or ops runbooks.
      Keep bullets concise; prefer one integration or component per bullet with citations.

  - id: coding_standard
    title: Coding Standard
    instruction: |
      List style guides, lint/test requirements, branching & review workflow, and documentation expectations.
      Pull details from standards docs, CONTRIBUTING guides, or task-specific governance notes.
      Flag discrepancies between sources as TODO items instead of guessing resolutions.

checks:
  - id: completeness
    instruction: "Verify each section is populated in order and references `templates/instruction-template.yaml` headings."
  - id: sourcing
    instruction: "Ensure every bullet cites a source or is explicitly marked TODO with next action."
  - id: clarity
    instruction: "Confirm the final document is scannable (no paragraph longer than five sentences)."
