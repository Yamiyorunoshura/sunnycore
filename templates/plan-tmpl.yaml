    filename: "{root}/docs/plan.md"
    title: "Execution Plan â€“ {task_id}: {task_name}"
    note: "Disposable planning document for this task; delete after completion."

sections:
  - id: context
    title: Task Context Snapshot
    instruction: |
      Summarize the task using the authoritative task file (include goal, scope, and success criteria).
      Highlight which inputs from the task document and role command files must be consulted before execution.
      Note any upstream dependencies or prerequisite approvals specific to this task.

  - id: constraints
    title: Constraints & References
    instruction: |
      Enumerate relevant constraints from CLAUDE.md, role commands, and the task document.
      Link each constraint to the files you will review (e.g., architecture docs, requirements, knowledge base).
      Capture mandatory tools, templates, or scripts the task requires.

  - id: execution
    title: Step-by-Step Plan
    instruction: |
      Translate the task's official steps into a checklist so each line begins with "- [ ]".
      Within each checklist entry, capture:
        - A concise action label with the task-specific focus.
        - The expected artifact or evidence to produce.
        - The validation approach you will run (tests, approvals, reviews).
      Preserve the task document's sequence and ensure no required step is omitted.

  - id: validation
    title: Validation & Evidence Strategy
    instruction: |
      Detail how you will prove completion of each required validation activity for this task.
      Include testing strategies, approval checkpoints, documentation updates, and rollback considerations.
      Reference the specific files or commands you will use to gather evidence.

  - id: knowledge_updates
    title: Documentation & Knowledge Updates
    instruction: |
      Specify which permanent documents (e.g., dev notes, knowledge base, architecture files) must be updated.
      Describe the task-specific insights or metrics you will capture for future reference.
      Identify where progress logging will occur (e.g., docs/progress.md) and what importance level to use.

  - id: risks
    title: Risks & Mitigations
    instruction: |
      List task-specific risks or blockers you anticipate, tied to the task's constraints or dependencies.
      Provide mitigation and rollback plans for each risk.

  - id: dod_alignment
    title: Definition of Done Alignment
    instruction: |
      Reproduce every Definition of Done item as a checklist entry formatted "- [ ]".
      For each checklist item, include the DoD text plus the plan evidence that will satisfy it.
      State how completion will be verified prior to closing the task.
