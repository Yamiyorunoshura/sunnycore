  name: Task Execution Plan
  version: 1.0
  output:
    format: markdown
    filename: "{root}/docs/plan.md"
    title: "Execution Plan â€“ {task_id}: {task_name}"
    note: "Disposable planning document for this task; delete after completion."

sections:
  - id: context
    title: Task Context Snapshot
    instruction: |
      Summarize the task using the authoritative task file (include goal, scope, and success criteria).
      Highlight which inputs from the task document and role command files must be consulted before execution.
      Note any upstream dependencies or prerequisite approvals specific to this task.

  - id: constraints
    title: Constraints & References
    instruction: |
      Enumerate relevant constraints from CLAUDE.md, role commands, and the task document.
      Link each constraint to the files you will review (e.g., architecture docs, requirements, knowledge base).
      Capture mandatory tools, templates, or scripts the task requires.

  - id: execution
    title: Step-by-Step Plan
    instruction: |
      Break the task's official steps into concrete actions tailored to this task.
      For each step, list:
        - Planned action (task-specific focus)
        - Expected artifact or evidence
        - Validation approach (tests, approvals, reviews)
      Make sure the sequence mirrors the task document's workflow without skipping steps.

  - id: validation
    title: Validation & Evidence Strategy
    instruction: |
      Detail how you will prove completion of each required validation activity for this task.
      Include testing strategies, approval checkpoints, documentation updates, and rollback considerations.
      Reference the specific files or commands you will use to gather evidence.

  - id: knowledge_updates
    title: Documentation & Knowledge Updates
    instruction: |
      Specify which permanent documents (e.g., dev notes, knowledge base, architecture files) must be updated.
      Describe the task-specific insights or metrics you will capture for future reference.
      Identify where progress logging will occur (e.g., docs/progress.md) and what importance level to use.

  - id: risks
    title: Risks & Mitigations
    instruction: |
      List task-specific risks or blockers you anticipate, tied to the task's constraints or dependencies.
      Provide mitigation and rollback plans for each risk.

  - id: dod_alignment
    title: Definition of Done Alignment
    instruction: |
      Reproduce every Definition of Done item from the task document.
      For each item, state the concrete plan actions or evidence that will satisfy it during execution.
      Confirm how you will verify completion before closing the task.
