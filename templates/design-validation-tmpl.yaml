    title: Recommendations
    instruction: |
      **Immediate Actions Required:**
      
      **If Critical or High Issues Found:**
      - Recommend using `/sunnycore_po *fix-design-conflicts` to resolve issues
      - Prioritize critical issues first (fabricated content, broken references)
      - Address high severity coverage gaps next
      
      **For Medium/Low Issues:**
      - List specific actions to improve consistency
      - Suggest standardization approaches
      
      **Next Steps:**
      
      **If Validation PASSED:**
      - Confirm design is consistent and complete
      - Recommend proceeding to implementation phase
      - Suggest review schedule for ongoing validation
      
      **If Validation FAILED:**
      - Estimated effort required: {hours/days}
      - Recommended approach: {fix critical first / comprehensive review}
      - Re-validation required after fixes

  - id: validation-scope
    title: Validation Scope and Context
    instruction: |
      **Documents Validated:**
      
      **For PRD Workflow:**
      - PRD: {path}
      - Architecture (if exists): {path or "N/A"}
      
      **For Full Workflow:**
      - Requirements: {REQ path}/*.md
      - Architecture: {ARCH path}/*.md  
      - Epic: {EPIC path}
      - Plans: {PLAN path}/*.md
      
      **Validation Checks Performed:**
      - ✓ Fabrication detection (referenced entities exist)
      - ✓ Broken reference detection (cross-references valid)
      - ✓ Coverage verification (100% traceability)
      - ✓ Consistency validation (naming, specifications)
      - ✓ Workflow-specific validations

  - id: appendix
    title: Technical Appendix
    instruction: |
      **Entity Index:**
      Document all entities found during validation for reference:

      **Components:** {ComponentA, ComponentB, etc.}
      **Tasks:** Task-1, Task-2, Task-3, etc.
      **Plans:** {plan-file-names}
      
      **Reference Map:**
      Show key relationships validated:
      - REQ-001 → {ComponentA, ComponentB} → {Task-1, Task-2}
      - REQ-002 → {ComponentC} → {Task-3}
