- Consistent scoring system definitions (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)

### 2. **Clarity & Actionability**: 75/100  
**Strengths**: Clear QA role intent, comprehensive 7-dimension evaluation framework, specific decision rules for Accept/Reject/Accept with Changes  
**Issues Identified**: Missing concrete implementation examples, insufficient output format specifications, vague constraint verification procedures  
**Score Calculation**: 85 (base) - 10 (missing examples and specificity) = 75  
**Supporting Evidence**: 
- Line 56-58: Output section too brief - "Task Implementation Results" lacks detail
- Evaluation criteria provide structure but need practical application examples

### 3. **Cognitive Load & Ambiguity Control**: 70/100
**Strengths**: Logical section organization, clear information hierarchy, well-defined quality matrix  
**Issues Identified**: Complex 7-dimension framework presented without sufficient guidance, long definition sentences (line 31), overwhelming detail without prioritization  
**Score Calculation**: 80 (base) - 10 (cognitive complexity) = 70  
**Supporting Evidence**: 
- Line 31: 關鍵問題 definition is 65+ characters creating cognitive burden
- Seven evaluation dimensions require mental juggling without clear workflow guidance

### 4. **Reasoning Guidance Appropriateness**: 78/100
**Strengths**: Structured evaluation approach, clear milestone checkpoints, systematic quality assessment methodology  
**Issues Identified**: Missing step-by-step reasoning chains, insufficient guidance for dimension prioritization  
**Score Calculation**: 82 (base) - 4 (guidance gaps) = 78  
**Supporting Evidence**: 
- Good framework structure but lacks procedural detail for complex evaluations
- Decision rules clear but implementation process underspecified

### 5. **Alignment & Relevance**: 90/100
**Strengths**: Perfect alignment with QA engineer role, comprehensive coverage of QA responsibilities, appropriate quality focus  
**Issues Identified**: Minor gaps in error handling procedures  
**Score Calculation**: 92 (base) - 2 (minor gaps) = 90  
**Supporting Evidence**: 
- Dr Thompson role definition matches QA engineering requirements
- 7-dimension framework covers all critical QA aspects
- Quality matrix directly supports QA decision-making

### 6. **Information Completeness & Minimality**: 72/100
**Strengths**: Core QA evaluation framework complete, essential constraints defined, quality scoring system comprehensive  
**Issues Identified**: Missing templates despite references (line 49-53), insufficient workflow detail, no error handling procedures  
**Score Calculation**: 80 (base) - 8 (missing critical information) = 72  
**Supporting Evidence**: 
- Line 49-53: References templates not provided in the prompt
- Custom commands section minimal compared to framework complexity

### 7. **Constraint Design Appropriateness**: 85/100
**Strengths**: Clear and verifiable constraints, appropriate importance levels, well-defined milestone checkpoints  
**Issues Identified**: Some constraints use subjective language requiring clarification  
**Score Calculation**: 88 (base) - 3 (subjectivity) = 85  
**Supporting Evidence**: 
- Eight critical constraints with clear compliance requirements
- Milestone checkpoints well-defined with specific QA focus
- Decision rules quantifiable through scoring system

### 8. **User Experience**: 73/100
**Strengths**: Clear role establishment, comprehensive evaluation structure, consistent quality standards  
**Issues Identified**: High complexity without sufficient user guidance, missing practical examples, incomplete workflow instructions  
**Score Calculation**: 80 (base) - 7 (usability gaps) = 73  
**Supporting Evidence**: 
- Complex 7-dimension framework may overwhelm users without experience
- Start sequence clear but lacks connection to main workflow

## Overall Assessment

**Total Score**: 78/100 (Average of 8 dimensions)  
**Quality Level**: Fair - Adequate quality requiring systematic improvements

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive QA Framework**: Excellent 7-dimension evaluation structure covering all critical QA aspects
2. **Clear Role Definition**: Dr Thompson character with appropriate QA personality traits and responsibilities  
3. **Quantifiable Quality Matrix**: Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum scoring system with clear decision rules
4. **Strong Constraint Design**: Well-defined milestone checkpoints and critical requirements
5. **Professional Structure**: Organized sections with appropriate XML-like formatting

### Necessary Improvements (High Priority)
1. **Add Practical Examples**: Include 2-3 concrete examples for each evaluation dimension showing how to apply criteria in real scenarios
2. **Enhance Output Specifications**: Expand output section with detailed format requirements, templates, and expected deliverable structure  
3. **Provide Workflow Guidance**: Add step-by-step procedure from task initiation through 7-dimension evaluation to final decision

### Recommended Enhancements (Medium Priority)
1. **Improve Formatting Consistency**: Standardize bullet point format in definitions section and custom commands
2. **Add Error Handling**: Include procedures for when milestone checkpoints fail or critical issues are identified
3. **Include Prioritization Guidelines**: Help users navigate the 7-dimension framework with priority guidance for different scenarios
4. **Enhance Personality Descriptions**: Add specific behavioral examples for Dr Thompson's traits in QA contexts

### Implementation Guidelines
**Maintain Semantic Equivalence**: All improvements must preserve the core QA evaluation framework, Dr Thompson role definition, and quality matrix decision system. Focus on enhancing usability while maintaining the prompt's comprehensive assessment capabilities.

**Priority Implementation Order**:
1. Add dimension-specific examples (immediate impact on actionability)
2. Expand output format specifications (critical for user understanding)  
3. Provide step-by-step workflow guidance (essential for task completion)
4. Implement formatting and enhancement improvements (quality polish)

## Conclusion
The sunnycore_qa.md prompt demonstrates solid foundation in QA methodology with comprehensive evaluation frameworks and appropriate quality standards. The core structure effectively supports QA engineering tasks, but requires systematic improvements in practical guidance and user experience to achieve higher quality classification. With targeted enhancements focusing on actionability and workflow clarity, this prompt can achieve Good to Excellent quality levels.
