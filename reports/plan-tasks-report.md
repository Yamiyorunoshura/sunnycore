# Quality Assessment Report: plan-tasks.md

## Executive Summary
**Target Prompt**: claude code/tasks/plan-tasks.md  
**Evaluation Date**: September 25, 2025  
**Overall Score**: 85/100  
**Quality Classification**: Good  

The prompt demonstrates strong design with a well-structured TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodology for implementation planning. It provides clear workflow stages, appropriate constraints, and practical examples that enhance usability.

## Dimensional Scores

### 1. **Correctness**: 87/100
**Strengths**: 
- Clean syntax and grammar throughout the document
- Logical structural consistency from input through workflow to output
- Proper TDD terminology usage (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle)
- Coherent flow through all 5 workflow stages

**Issues Identified**: 
- Minor path formatting inconsistency: Line 125 uses `docs/implementation-plan` while other references use `{root}/docs/implementation-plan/`
- Mixed Chinese-English content in examples (lines 86-91) without clear language specification

**Score Calculation**: Base score 90 - 3 points for path inconsistency = 87/100  
**Supporting Evidence**: "Generate Markdown plan to docs/implementation-plan" (line 125) vs "{root}/docs/implementation-plan/{task_id}-plan.md" (line 13)

### 2. **Clarity & Actionability**: 82/100
**Strengths**:
- Clear intent: TDD-based implementation planning explicitly stated
- Actionable steps with specific verification questions at each stage
- Unambiguous execution path through 5 well-defined stages
- Concrete examples for todo list format and markdown conversion

**Issues Identified**:
- Constraint "Map every plan item to requirement IDs" (line 18) lacks specificity about mapping format
- Some workflow questions could be more specific about evaluation criteria

**Score Calculation**: Base score 85 - 3 points for mapping specificity = 82/100  
**Supporting Evidence**: Questions like "Are acceptance criteria specific, measurable, and verifiable?" provide good guidance but could include specific metrics

### 3. **Cognitive Load & Ambiguity Control**: 83/100
**Strengths**:
- Well-structured progressive disclosure through 5 distinct stages
- Good use of verification questions to reduce ambiguity
- Clear information architecture with logical grouping

**Issues Identified**:
- TDD methodology assumes familiarity with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR concepts
- Some technical terms like "cross-cutting concerns" used without definition

**Score Calculation**: Base score 85 - 2 points for technical assumptions = 83/100  
**Supporting Evidence**: Stage names clearly indicate TDD phases, but concepts like "cross-cutting concerns" (line 63) need clarification

### 4. **Reasoning Guidance Appropriateness**: 88/100
**Strengths**:
- Excellent use of structured reasoning through TDD methodology
- Verification questions guide quality without over-constraining
- Appropriate balance between guidance and creative freedom

**Issues Identified**:
- Could benefit from more specific guidance on prioritization criteria
- Some questions are somewhat generic rather than task-specific

**Score Calculation**: Base score 90 - 2 points for prioritization guidance = 88/100  
**Supporting Evidence**: Questions like "Are solutions minimal and focused?" provide good guidance for the GREEN phase

### 5. **Alignment & Relevance**: 92/100
**Strengths**:
- Perfect alignment with implementation planning objectives
- All content directly contributes to TDD-based planning process
- Excellent policy compliance for planning context
- Strong focus on requirement traceability

**Issues Identified**:
- Minor: Some example content mixing languages without clear context

**Score Calculation**: Base score 95 - 3 points for language mixing = 92/100  
**Supporting Evidence**: All workflow stages directly support the core objective of creating traceable implementation plans

### 6. **Information Completeness & Minimality**: 86/100
**Strengths**:
- Complete information for task execution: inputs, outputs, workflow, templates
- Good balance between necessary detail and conciseness
- Critical specifications clearly defined (paths, formats, constraints)
- Practical examples enhance completeness

**Issues Identified**:
- Could include more specific guidance on template usage
- Success/failure criteria could be more explicit

**Score Calculation**: Base score 90 - 4 points for template guidance specificity = 86/100  
**Supporting Evidence**: Template reference "sunnycore/templates/implementation-plan-tmpl.yaml" provided but usage not detailed

### 7. **Constraint Design Appropriateness**: 87/100
**Strengths**:
- Clear and feasible constraints that enhance quality
- Quality-focused requirements (requirement traceability, ATX headings)
- Appropriate scope without over-constraining creativity
- Verifiable constraints through observable outputs

**Issues Identified**:
- Some constraints could be more specific about verification methods
- "Exactly one file" constraint could clarify handling of complex plans

**Score Calculation**: Base score 90 - 3 points for verification specificity = 87/100  
**Supporting Evidence**: "Derive tasks strictly from provided documents" is clear and verifiable

### 8. **User Experience**: 85/100
**Strengths**:
- High practical utility producing usable implementation plans
- Good operational efficiency with structured 5-stage workflow
- Well-suited for systematic application
- Examples significantly enhance usability

**Issues Identified**:
- Could benefit from more guidance on handling edge cases
- Todo list format example could be more comprehensive

**Score Calculation**: Base score 88 - 3 points for edge case guidance = 85/100  
**Supporting Evidence**: Todo list example provides clear format but could include more workflow variation examples

## Overall Score Calculation
**Total Score**: (87 + 82 + 83 + 88 + 92 + 86 + 87 + 85) รท 8 = **85/100**

## Quality Classification: Good (80-89 points)
The prompt demonstrates high quality with targeted enhancement opportunities. It successfully implements a sophisticated TDD methodology for implementation planning while maintaining clarity and actionability.

## Structured Feedback

### Strengths
1. **Excellent TDD Implementation**: Well-structured RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle provides robust planning methodology
2. **Clear Workflow Progression**: 5-stage structure with verification questions ensures quality outcomes
3. **Practical Examples**: Todo list format and markdown conversion examples significantly enhance usability
4. **Strong Constraint Design**: Requirements for traceability and format consistency promote quality outputs
5. **Good Input/Output Contracts**: Clear specification of required inputs and expected outputs

### Necessary Improvements (High Priority)
1. **Path Consistency**: Standardize all path references to use {root}/ prefix format throughout document
2. **Mapping Specification**: Define specific format and requirements for "mapping plan items to requirement IDs"
3. **Language Consistency**: Clarify language expectations or separate multilingual examples with context

### Recommended Enhancements (Medium Priority)
1. **Technical Term Definitions**: Add brief definitions for terms like "cross-cutting concerns" and TDD concepts
2. **Template Usage Guidance**: Provide more specific instructions on how to utilize the implementation-plan-tmpl.yaml
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Include guidance for handling complex scenarios (multiple interdependent requirements, conflicting constraints)
4. **Verification Criteria**: Make constraint verification methods more explicit and measurable

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **For Path Consistency**: Replace line 125 "docs/implementation-plan" with "{root}/docs/implementation-plan/{task_id}-plan.md"
2. **For Mapping Specification**: Add specific format requirements like "Each plan item must include requirement ID in [REQ-XXX] format"
3. **For Technical Definitions**: Add a brief glossary section or inline definitions for specialized terms
4. **Maintain Semantic Equivalence**: All improvements should preserve the core TDD methodology and workflow structure

## Conclusion
The plan-tasks.md prompt represents a well-designed implementation planning tool with strong methodological foundation. The TDD approach provides excellent structure for creating traceable, testable implementation plans. With minor consistency improvements and enhanced specificity in key areas, this prompt could achieve excellence level quality while maintaining its current strengths in clarity and practical utility.
