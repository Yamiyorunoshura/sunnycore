    "HIGH: Correct the stage 2 tools block by replacing '<tools/>' with '</tools>'.",
    "MEDIUM: Add an explicit 'Deliverable:' line for stage 3 (e.g., 'Final JSON report saved to reports/').",
    "LOW: Clarify the final-stage check 'Every output item includes \"Format\" and \"Example\" lines' or replace with a more actionable acceptance check."

  "advisory_suggestions": [
    "Reiterate the language policy (English) at top-level to avoid drift.",
    "Optionally add a retry-on-validation-failure note (up to 2 attempts).",

  "strengths": [
    "Guide-aligned tasks structure with snake_case stage IDs.",
    "Measurable constraints and final-stage checks.",
    "Clear role boundaries and scoped deliverables for stages 1 and 2."
  ],
  "summary": "Classified as tasks. Strong structure with measurable constraints and final checks. To reach template-grade quality, add a concrete JSON Schema, correct the stage 2 tools closure, and fix the template path; optionally label stage 3 deliverable."
