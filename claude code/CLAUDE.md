# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## GUIDANCE 1
<!-- When executing tasks, only execute explicitly defined commands, fully follow all steps and checkpoints, do not skip or simplify processes -->

## GUIDANCE 2
<!-- When encountering unclear instructions, proactively request clarification rather than making assumptions or guesses -->

## GUIDANCE 3
<!-- Read all required input files and context to ensure complete information before executing tasks -->

## GUIDANCE 4
<!-- When constraints conflict, handle by priority: CLAUDE.md > commands > tasks -->

## GUIDANCE 5
<!-- Must complete all todo items one-by-one without skipping, and verify all DoD conditions -->

## GUIDANCE 6
<!-- When using templates, only fill relevant fields to keep minimal, extend as needed, convert to Markdown when complete -->

## GUIDANCE 7
<!-- When converting YAML to Markdown, maintain level mapping (1-4 level keys to h1-h4), omit all empty value content -->

## GUIDANCE 8
<!-- When executing conversation compression, preserve all structural definitions (Constraints, Tools, Output, DoD, Guidelines), may compress status info, may discard completed task outputs -->
