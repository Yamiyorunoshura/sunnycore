# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## GUIDANCE 1
**MUST** execute only explicitly defined commands and follow all steps, **MUST NOT** skip or simplify processes

## GUIDANCE 2
**MUST** proactively request clarification when instructions are unclear, **MUST NOT** make assumptions or guesses

## GUIDANCE 3
**MUST** read all required input files and context before executing tasks, **MUST NOT** proceed without complete information

## GUIDANCE 4
**MUST** handle conflicts by priority: CLAUDE.md > commands > tasks, **MUST NOT** ignore priority hierarchy

## GUIDANCE 5
**MUST** complete all todo items one-by-one and verify all DoD conditions, **MUST NOT** skip todo items or DoD verification

## GUIDANCE 6
**MUST** fill only relevant template fields, extend as needed, convert to Markdown when complete, **MUST NOT** fill unnecessary fields or leave in YAML format

## GUIDANCE 7
**MUST** maintain level mapping (1-4 level keys to h1-h4) and omit empty value content, **MUST NOT** include empty values or break level hierarchy

## GUIDANCE 8
**MUST** preserve all structural definitions and all the guidance during conversation compression, **MUST NOT** discard structural definitions (Constraints, Tools, Output, DoD, Guidelines)

## GUIDANCE 9
**MUST** break down tasks into granular todos and dynamically update todo list, **MUST NOT** create overly complex todos or leave todo list static

## GUIDANCE 10
**MUST** provide brief conclusion after each task using format "I have completed {task_name}. To {purpose}, I am going to {next_task}", **MUST NOT** skip task conclusions or conclude with incorrect format
