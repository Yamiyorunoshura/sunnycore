<start sequence>
1. MUST read all required input files specified in context and templates sections before proceeding with any command execution
2. MUST read the corresponding task file (e.g., {root}/sunnycore/tasks/plan-tasks.md, {root}/sunnycore/tasks/create-requirements.md, {root}/sunnycore/tasks/create-architecture.md, {root}/sunnycore/tasks/help.md) to understand the specific workflow stages and requirements
3. MUST create structured todo list using todo_write tool based on BOTH the workflow stages defined in the task file AND the todo format examples provided in this command file
4. MUST execute workflow stages sequentially following the created todo list, updating todo status throughout execution and ensuring first todo item is marked as "in_progress"
</start sequence>

## Todo List Format Templates
**IMPORTANT**: These are FORMAT TEMPLATES only. Actual workflow stages MUST be read from corresponding task files before creating todo lists.

**Template Structure Based on PM Command Type:**
```javascript
// For *help command
[
  {"id": "stage-1-{action_from_task_file}", "content": "Stage 1: {description_from_help_md}", "status": "in_progress"}
]

// For *plan-tasks {task_id} command
[
  {"id": "stage-1-{plan_stage_1}", "content": "Stage 1: {stage_1_from_plan_tasks_md}", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"id": "stage-2-{plan_stage_2}", "content": "Stage 2: {stage_2_from_plan_tasks_md}", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "stage-N-{plan_stage_n}", "content": "Stage N: {final_stage_from_plan_tasks_md}", "status": "pending"}
]

// For *create-requirements command
[
  {"id": "stage-1-{req_stage_1}", "content": "Stage 1: {stage_1_from_create_requirements_md}", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"id": "stage-N-{req_stage_n}", "content": "Stage N: {final_stage_from_create_requirements_md}", "status": "pending"}
]

// For *create-architecture command
[
  {"id": "stage-1-{arch_stage_1}", "content": "Stage 1: {stage_1_from_create_architecture_md}", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"id": "stage-N-{arch_stage_n}", "content": "Stage N: {final_stage_from_create_architecture_md}", "status": "pending"}
]

// For *create-tasks command
[
  {"id": "stage-1-{tasks_stage_1}", "content": "Stage 1: {stage_1_from_create_tasks_md}", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"id": "stage-N-{tasks_stage_n}", "content": "Stage N: {final_stage_from_create_tasks_md}", "status": "pending"}
]

// For *create-brownfield-architecture command
[
  {"id": "stage-1-{bf_arch_stage_1}", "content": "Stage 1: {stage_1_from_create_brownfield_architecture_md}", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"id": "stage-N-{bf_arch_stage_n}", "content": "Stage N: {final_stage_from_create_brownfield_architecture_md}", "status": "pending"}
]
```
