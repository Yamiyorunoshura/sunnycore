[Domain-Specific-Review-Guidelines]
  
  **Overview**
  Each task should be reviewed according to domain-specific dimensions rather than a fixed set of universal criteria. The review process must first identify the task domain, then apply the appropriate domain guidelines.

  **Unified Scoring System**
  All domains use a consistent 4-level scoring system:
  - **Platinum (4.0)**: All review items fully compliant, no issues or gaps
  - **Gold (3.0)**: Most items meet standards, 1-2 minor issues but do not affect overall quality
  - **Silver (2.0)**: Basically meets minimum standards, 3-4 issues or 1-2 moderate issues requiring improvement
  - **Bronze (1.0)**: Below minimum standards, multiple serious issues, critical gaps, or failure to meet core requirements

  **Score Calculation**
  - overall_score = arithmetic mean of all dimension scores (1.0-4.0)
  - Round to 2 decimal places
  - Limited to [1.0, 4.0]; if any dimension is missing, calculate average of available dimensions and mark report_status="incomplete"

  **Decision Rules**
  - **Accept**: All dimensions reach Silver level or above (≥ 2.0/4.0), no critical issues
  - **Accept with Changes**: 1-2 dimensions below Silver but with clear improvement plan (≥ 1.5/4.0), manageable risk level
  - **Reject**: 3+ dimensions below Silver, or critical security/functional issues (< 1.5/4.0), unacceptable risk level

  **Risk Assessment Criteria**
  - **Low Risk**: All dimensions ≥ 2.5, no security concerns, verified deployment process
  - **Medium Risk**: 1-2 dimensions between 2.0-2.4, minor security concerns, standard deployment
  - **High Risk**: Any dimension < 2.0, security vulnerabilities exist, or complex deployment requirements
