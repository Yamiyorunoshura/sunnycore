[Project-Summary-Guidelines]
  1. **Decision Transparency and Traceability**
    - Record all key decisions with rationale, background context, and decision timing
    - Explain decision impact scope and expected benefits
    - Preserve discussions and trade-offs during decision-making process
  
  2. **Technical Choice Trade-offs**
    - Explain comparative analysis of technical choices and alternatives
    - Include selection rationale, pros/cons evaluation, and applicable scenarios
    - Record technical debt and future optimization directions
  
  3. **Issue Tracking and Root Cause Analysis**
    - Fully document issues encountered during development process
    - Include issue description, root cause analysis, solutions, and preventive measures
    - Annotate issue impact scope and fix costs
  
  4. **Evidence Support and Verifiability**
    - Provide verifiable evidence for all key statements (format: file_path:line_number)
    - Reference actual code, test results, or document sections
    - Ensure summary content is traceable to specific sources
  
  5. **Forward-Looking Recommendations**
    - Propose future improvement directions based on project experience
    - Identify optimizable processes, tools, or practices
    - Provide specific actionable recommendations

[Knowledge-Management-Guidelines]
  1. **Quality Grading and Filtering**
    - Only include platinum-level practices in best practices repository
    - Platinum level is marked by review reports, no need for self-determination
    - If no platinum-level practices exist, record "No sufficiently validated best practices at this stage" and explain reasons
  
  2. **Completeness and Structured Recording**
    - Best practices must include: title, description, applicable scenarios, evidence sources
    - Error cases must include: error type, occurrence context, solutions, preventive measures
    - Each knowledge point should be reproducible and verifiable
  
  3. **Evidence Traceability and Source Annotation**
    - Annotate knowledge sources (format: file_path + section, e.g., docs/dev-notes/feature-x.md [Error Handling] section)
    - Ensure knowledge points are traceable to original documents and context
    - Preserve sufficient contextual information for future reference
  
  4. **Conflict Resolution and Decision Support**
    - When contradictory practices are discovered, preserve all evidence for future decisions
    - Annotate conflict points and applicable scenarios for different practices
    - Do not force choices, but provide complete information to support context-based decisions
  
  5. **Knowledge Base Organization Structure**
    - Classify knowledge base by technical domain, error type, or development phase
    - Choose appropriate organization method based on actual content volume and diversity
    - Ensure knowledge base structure is clear, easy to search and maintain

[Architecture-Management-Guidelines]
  1. **Structural Integrity and Template Compliance**
    - Ensure architecture documentation follows template structure, including all necessary sections
    - Verify section order, naming conventions, and format consistency
    - Check if documentation includes necessary elements (overview, components, data flows, decision records, etc.)
  
  2. **Source Traceability and Reference Completeness**
    - Each architecture document must annotate source references (source_refs)
    - Ensure all architecture decisions have clear requirement or business drivers
    - Establish bidirectional links between architecture documentation and requirements, implementation
  
  3. **Consistency Maintenance and Synchronization**
    - Keep architecture documentation synchronized with actual code
    - Regularly verify alignment between architecture descriptions and implementation
    - Identify and record architecture drift and unplanned changes
  
  4. **Terminology Standardization and Communication**
    - Use unified terminology and naming conventions
    - Establish and maintain project glossary
    - Ensure concept and naming consistency across documents
  
  5. **Version Management and Evolution Tracking**
    - Track architecture evolution history and change rationale
    - Record motivation, impact, and migration path for each architecture change
    - Preserve comparison and upgrade guidance between architecture versions
