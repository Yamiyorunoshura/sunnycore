<input>
  <context>
  1. {root}/sunnycore/CLAUDE.md - Core project documentation and guidelines
  2. User commands and task identifiers for development workflow execution
  3. Project templates and task definitions for structured development processes

  <tasks>
  1. Perform lexical analysis and semantic validation of user-submitted command directives
  2. Orchestrate execution of corresponding development workflow automation pipelines
  3. Generate structured deliverables with actionable technical guidance and implementation roadmaps
  </tasks>

<output>
1. Comprehensive command validation diagnostics with detailed execution status reporting
2. Systematically structured development workflow artifacts and intermediate deliverables
3. Prioritized action items with strategic recommendations and implementation guidance
</output>

<constraints importance="Critical">
- Must validate command syntax using pattern matching before execution (commands must start with * and contain valid identifiers)
- All file paths must exist and be readable; throw specific error messages for missing files with full path resolution
- Must execute *help command automatically when user input doesn't match any defined custom_commands pattern
- Must respond in Traditional Chinese for explanations while preserving all English technical terms, code snippets, and file paths exactly as written
- Must maintain consistent file naming conventions: kebab-case for directories, no spaces in paths, preserve {root} placeholder resolution
- Must not execute commands with missing required parameters (task_id required for develop-tasks and brownfield-tasks commands)
</constraints>

<custom_commands>
- *help
  - Read {root}/sunnycore/tasks/help.md
  - Execute help workflow stages
  - Provide comprehensive command usage guidance
- *develop-tasks {task_id}
  - Read {root}/sunnycore/tasks/develop-tasks.md
  - Execute development workflow stages for specified task
  - Generate development artifacts and implementation plans
- *brownfield-tasks {task_id}
  - Read {root}/sunnycore/tasks/brownfield-tasks.md
  - Execute brownfield improvement workflow stages
  - Provide legacy system analysis and modernization strategies
</custom_commands>

<workflow importance="Important">
  <stage id="1: input-validation">
  - Systematically ingest and semantically analyze all input context documentation
  - Perform lexical parsing of user directives to extract command identifiers and parameter payloads
  - Execute syntactic validation against predefined command schemas and parameter constraints
  - Resolve command existence through lookup operations against registered custom_commands registry
  
  <questions>
  - Does the command directive adhere to established syntactic conventions (asterisk prefix, pattern matching) with complete mandatory parameter resolution?
  - Are the referenced contextual artifacts ({root}/sunnycore/CLAUDE.md) accessible via filesystem operations and structurally compliant with expected schemas?
  - What resilience mechanisms should be implemented when task_id parameters fail to resolve against existing workflow definition registry?
  </questions>
  </stage>
  
  <stage id="2: command-execution">
  - Implement fallback mechanism to auto-invoke *help workflow for malformed or unrecognized command inputs
  - Dynamically load and instantiate corresponding task template configurations from filesystem
  - Orchestrate sequential execution of all defined workflow stages with proper dependency management
  - Synthesize structured deliverables conforming to template specifications and output format requirements
  
  <questions>
  - Are all referenced template artifacts ({root}/sunnycore/tasks/*.md) filesystem-accessible with valid workflow stage configuration metadata?
  - What fault-tolerance strategies should be implemented for partial workflow execution failures and missing intermediate artifact dependencies?
  - What quantifiable success criteria define completion states for each command classification, and how can output quality assurance be programmatically validated?
  </questions>
  
  <checks>
  - [ ] Command validation pipeline successfully completed: input conforms to regex pattern `*[command-identifier]` with accurate parameter cardinality validation
  - [ ] All referenced template artifacts successfully instantiated with non-zero content payloads and verified structural integrity
  - [ ] Workflow orchestration generates comprehensively structured deliverables encompassing all mandated sections (validation diagnostics, workflow execution artifacts, strategic implementation recommendations)
  - [ ] Exception handling mechanisms provide granular filesystem path resolution with prescriptive remediation procedures for inaccessible resources
  - [ ] Linguistic output maintains Traditional Chinese semantic clarity while preserving immutable English technical nomenclature and identifier integrity
  - [ ] Deliverable artifacts maintain strict conformance to established project template schemas with consistent documentation formatting standards
