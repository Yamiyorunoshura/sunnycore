  **Key Terminology with Validation Criteria:**
  - **Workflow Stages**: Structured execution phases with defined inputs, processes, outputs, and measurable milestones. Validation: Each stage must have completion criteria >90% before progression.
  - **Brownfield Tasks**: Legacy system improvement tasks requiring minimum 70% backward compatibility while introducing modern practices. Validation: Must include compatibility matrix and migration timeline.
  - **task_id**: Unique identifier allowing alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and dots only. Validation: Must match regex `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` and be 3-50 characters long.
  - **Systematic Analysis**: Structured evaluation including requirement gathering, technical assessment, risk analysis, and implementation planning. Validation: Must include quantifiable metrics and documented assumptions.
  - **Checkpoint Validation**: Progress verification at each workflow stage requiring completion confirmation, quality checks, and readiness assessment. Validation: Must achieve >90% completion score before proceeding.

## Command Format and Validation Reference

### Valid Command Syntax
**Pattern**: `^\*(help|develop-tasks|brownfield-tasks)(\s+[A-Za-z0-9._-]+)?$`

**Valid Examples:**
```
*help                           → Execute help workflow (no parameters required)
*develop-tasks user-auth-api    → Execute development workflow with task_id validation
*brownfield-tasks legacy.sys    → Execute brownfield analysis with legacy system identifier
```

### Error Handling and Recovery
```
❌ develop-tasks               → ERR_001: Missing asterisk prefix
   Auto-action: Execute *help with error explanation

❌ *develop-tasks             → ERR_002: Missing required task_id parameter  
   Auto-action: Execute *help with parameter requirements

❌ *invalid-command           → ERR_001: Unrecognized command format
   Auto-action: Execute *help with valid command list

❌ *develop-tasks task@123     → ERR_004: Invalid task_id format (special characters)
   Auto-action: Provide format correction guidance
```

### Error Report JSON Structure
```json
{
  "error_code": "ERR_001|ERR_002|ERR_003|ERR_004",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00+08:00",
  "error_description": "Human-readable error message in Traditional Chinese",
  "suggested_action": "Specific remediation steps with examples", 
  "auto_fallback": "Automatic action taken by system",
  "context_info": "Environment details and file paths for debugging"
}
```
</example>

<instructions>
- **Command Processing Workflow**: 1) Parse input using regex validation with error code assignment, 2) Validate parameters and verify file accessibility with detailed logging, 3) Execute corresponding task workflow with progress tracking, 4) Generate structured output with completion verification
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Implement graceful degradation with automatic fallback to *help command, provide detailed error reports with specific error codes (ERR_001-ERR_004), include actionable resolution guidance with examples
- **File Operations**: Verify file existence and readability before processing, use absolute paths with proper error logging, implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintain completion status at each workflow stage with checkpoint validation, implement real-time progress updates with measurable metrics (>90% completion rate), provide milestone verification and quality scoring
- **Decision Support**: For complex scenarios, provide decision trees with clear criteria, include risk assessment and mitigation strategies, ensure evidence-based recommendations with quantifiable justifications
</instructions>

<checks>
- [ ] Command syntax validation passes regex pattern match with specific error code assignment
- [ ] All referenced task files exist and are accessible with proper error handling
- [ ] Output contains all required structured fields (timestamp, status, validation_details, resolution_hints)
- [ ] Error handling mechanisms function correctly with appropriate fallback and comprehensive error codes (ERR_001-ERR_004)
- [ ] Response language complies with Traditional Chinese requirement while preserving all English technical terms and file paths
- [ ] Progress tracking metrics are measurable, verifiable, and achieve >90% completion rate with documented checkpoint validation
</checks>
