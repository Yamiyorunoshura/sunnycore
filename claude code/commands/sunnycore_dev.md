2. MUST read the corresponding task file (e.g., {root}/sunnycore/tasks/develop-tasks.md, {root}/sunnycore/tasks/brownfield-tasks.md, {root}/sunnycore/tasks/help.md) to understand the specific workflow stages and requirements
3. MUST create structured todo list using todo_write tool based on BOTH the workflow stages defined in the task file AND the todo format examples provided in this command file

  - **Brownfield Tasks**: Legacy system improvement tasks requiring minimum 70% backward compatibility while introducing modern practices. Validation: Must include compatibility matrix and migration timeline.
  - **task_id**: Unique identifier allowing alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and dots only. Validation: Must match regex `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` and be 3-50 characters long.
  - **Systematic Analysis**: Structured evaluation including requirement gathering, technical assessment, risk analysis, and implementation planning. Validation: Must include quantifiable metrics and documented assumptions.
  - **Checkpoint Validation**: Progress verification at each workflow stage requiring completion confirmation, quality checks, and readiness assessment. Validation: Must achieve >90% completion score before proceeding.

## Command Format and Validation Reference

### Valid Command Syntax
**Pattern**: `^\*(help|develop-tasks|brownfield-tasks)(\s+[A-Za-z0-9._-]+)?$`

**Valid Examples:**
```
*help                           → Execute help workflow (no parameters required)
*develop-tasks user-auth-api    → Execute development workflow with task_id validation
*brownfield-tasks legacy.sys    → Execute brownfield analysis with legacy system identifier
```

### Todo List Creation Using todo_write Tool
**Universal Format for All Commands:**
```javascript
// For *help command
[
  {"id": "stage-1-display-help", "content": "Stage 1: 顯示可用自定義指令清單", "status": "in_progress"}
]

// For *develop-tasks {task_id} command  
[
  {"id": "stage-1-read-plan", "content": "Stage 1: 讀取並分析實作計劃文檔", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"id": "stage-2-implement-tests", "content": "Stage 2: 實作測試案例 (TDD RED 階段)", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "stage-3-implement-code", "content": "Stage 3: 實作最小代碼 (TDD GREEN 階段)", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "stage-4-refactor-optimize", "content": "Stage 4: 重構與優化代碼 (TDD REFACTOR 階段)", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "stage-5-create-notes", "content": "Stage 5: 生成開發筆記文檔", "status": "pending"}
]

// For *brownfield-tasks {task_id} command
[
  {"id": "stage-1-analyze-issues", "content": "Stage 1: 分析審查結果並識別問題", "status": "in_progress"},
  {"id": "stage-2-implement-fixes", "content": "Stage 2: 實作問題修復", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "stage-3-execute-recommendations", "content": "Stage 3: 執行建議改進措施", "status": "pending"},
  {"id": "stage-4-update-notes", "content": "Stage 4: 更新開發筆記", "status": "pending"}
]
```

### Error Handling and Recovery
```
❌ develop-tasks               → ERR_001: Missing asterisk prefix
   Auto-action: Execute *help with error explanation

❌ *develop-tasks             → ERR_002: Missing required task_id parameter  
   Auto-action: Execute *help with parameter requirements

❌ *invalid-command           → ERR_001: Unrecognized command format
   Auto-action: Execute *help with valid command list

❌ *develop-tasks task@123     → ERR_004: Invalid task_id format (special characters)
   Auto-action: Provide format correction guidance
```

### Error Report JSON Structure
```json
{
  "error_code": "ERR_001|ERR_002|ERR_003|ERR_004",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00+08:00",
  "error_description": "Human-readable error message in Traditional Chinese",
  "suggested_action": "Specific remediation steps with examples", 
  "auto_fallback": "Automatic action taken by system",
  "context_info": "Environment details and file paths for debugging"
}
```
</example>

<instructions>
- **Command Processing Workflow**: 1) Parse input using regex validation with error code assignment, 2) Validate parameters and verify file accessibility with detailed logging, 3) Create structured todo list using todo_write tool based on command type, 4) Execute corresponding task workflow with progress tracking, 5) Generate structured output with completion verification
- **Todo List Management**: Use todo_write tool immediately after command validation to create structured workflow tracking with appropriate todo items based on command type (help/develop-tasks/brownfield-tasks), ensure first todo item is marked as "in_progress", update todo status throughout execution
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Implement graceful degradation with automatic fallback to *help command, provide detailed error reports with specific error codes (ERR_001-ERR_004), include actionable resolution guidance with examples
- **File Operations**: Verify file existence and readability before processing, use absolute paths with proper error logging, implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintain completion status at each workflow stage with checkpoint validation, implement real-time progress updates with measurable metrics (>90% completion rate), provide milestone verification and quality scoring
- **Decision Support**: For complex scenarios, provide decision trees with clear criteria, include risk assessment and mitigation strategies, ensure evidence-based recommendations with quantifiable justifications
