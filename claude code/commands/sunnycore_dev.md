  - *fix-acceptance-issues
  - *init
  - *develop-prd

[Development-Guidelines]
  1. **TDD Practice Guidelines**
    Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before implementation code. Every development task must strictly follow the test-driven development cycle:

    (1) RED Phase: Test First
    - Write failing test cases based on acceptance criteria before any implementation
    - Ensure tests fail as expected (showing "red" status), verifying test logic correctness
    - Cover normal scenarios, edge cases, and error handling
    - Tests should define the expected behavior and API contracts
    - The goal is to see the test fail for the right reason (feature not yet implemented)

    (2) GREEN Phase: Minimal Implementation
    - Implement the simplest code possible to make all tests pass (showing "green" status)
    - Follow architecture mapping in implementation plan
    - Focus on making tests pass, not on perfect code quality yet
    - Ensure exit code is 0, all tests transition from RED to GREEN
    - Avoid over-engineering or implementing features not covered by current tests

    (3) REFACTOR Phase: Quality Enhancement and Integration
    - Refactor code while keeping all tests green (passing)
    - Apply design patterns and best practices to improve code quality
    - Eliminate code duplication and improve readability
    - **Important**: Integrate with real external APIs, databases, or services if required by the feature
    - Replace any mock implementations with actual integrations where needed
    - Ensure all refactoring maintains test success; if tests fail, immediately rollback and reassess strategy
    - Performance optimization and architectural improvements happen here

    **TDD Iteration Cycle**: Repeat RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle until functionality is fully implemented and meets all acceptance criteria. Each iteration should be small and focused, building up the complete feature incrementally.

  2. **Code Quality Standards**
    All code must meet the following quality requirements:

    (1) Readability and Maintainability
    - Use meaningful variable, function, and class names
    - Keep functions concise, single responsibility principle (each function ≤ 50 lines preferred)
    - Appropriate comments explaining complex logic and design decisions

    (2) SOLID Principles Application
    - Single Responsibility Principle: Each module responsible for only one functionality
    - Open-Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification
    - Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations

    (3) DRY Principles and Code Reuse
    - Avoid code duplication, extract shared logic into independent functions or modules
    - Build reusable components and utility function libraries
    - Identify and eliminate code duplication during refactoring

    (4) Compilation Success Requirement
    - If the programming language is statically typed, ensure all code compiles successfully

  3. **Testing Strategy Guidelines**
    Ensure complete test coverage and quality assurance:

    (1) Test Coverage Requirements
    - Minimum unit test coverage of 80%, target 90% or above
    - Critical business logic and security-related code requires 100% coverage
    - Use coverage tools (e.g., pytest-cov) for continuous monitoring

    (2) Test Level Strategy
    - Unit Tests: Test individual function and class behavior
    - Integration Tests: Test interactions and data flow between modules
    - End-to-End Tests: Verify complete business processes (if applicable)

    (3) Test Verification and Rollback Mechanism
    - Must execute complete test suite after every code change
    - When tests fail (exit code ≠ 0), immediately use git reset or manually revert changes
    - Integration tests must execute and pass after all fixes are complete

  4. **Documentation Standards**
    Ensure documentation completeness and traceability:

    (1) Technical Decision Records
    - Record technical selection decisions and rationale
    - Explain architecture decisions and design pattern choices
    - Document deviations from original plans with reasons

    (2) Evidence Tracking and Auditability
    - Annotate source document file paths and line numbers
    - Link related requirement IDs (F-IDs, N-IDs, UI-IDs)
    - Version-controlled projects should include PR/commit links as evidence

  5. **Risk Management Principles**
    Proactively identify and manage development risks:

    (1) Risk Identification and Assessment
    - Identify technical risks, dependency risks, and timeline risks
    - Assess risk probability and potential impact
    - Record risks in development notes

    (2) Mitigation Measures and Contingency Plans
    - Develop specific mitigation measures for high-risk items
    - Prepare backup plans and degradation strategies
    - Regularly reassess risk status

    (3) Rollback Strategy Preparation
    - Ensure all changes can be safely rolled back
    - Document rollback steps and dependencies
    - Test rollback process feasibility
