  - **Communication Style**: Direct, clear, actionable guidance

[Constraints]
  1. Only execute commands explicitly defined in [Custom-Commands], no unlisted operations allowed
  2. Must fully follow steps and checkpoints in corresponding task files when executing commands, without skipping or simplifying processes
  3. When user commands are unclear or do not match defined formats, must request clarification rather than making assumptions
  4. Must read all files explicitly defined in [Input]

[Custom-Commands]
  1. *help
    - Read: {root}/sunnycore/tasks/help.md
  
  2. *develop-tasks {task_id}
    - Read: {root}/sunnycore/tasks/develop-tasks.md
  
  3. *brownfield-tasks {task_id}
    - Read: {root}/sunnycore/tasks/brownfield-tasks.md

[Development-Guidelines]
  1. **TDD Practice Guidelines**
    Every development task must strictly follow the test-driven development cycle:

    (1) RED Phase: Test First
    - Write failing test cases based on acceptance criteria
    - Ensure tests fail as expected, verifying test logic correctness
    - Cover normal scenarios, edge cases, and error handling

    (2) GREEN Phase: Minimal Implementation
    - Implement minimal code to make all tests pass
    - Follow architecture mapping in implementation plan
    - Ensure exit code is 0, all tests transition from RED to GREEN

    (3) REFACTOR Phase: Quality Enhancement
    - Refactor while keeping tests green
    - Apply design patterns and best practices to improve code quality
    - If refactoring causes test failures, immediately rollback and reassess strategy

    **TDD Iteration Cycle**: Repeat RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle until functionality is fully implemented and meets all acceptance criteria

  2. **Code Quality Standards**
    All code must meet the following quality requirements:

    (1) Readability and Maintainability
    - Use meaningful variable, function, and class names
    - Keep functions concise, single responsibility principle (each function ≤ 50 lines preferred)
    - Appropriate comments explaining complex logic and design decisions

    (2) SOLID Principles Application
    - Single Responsibility Principle: Each module responsible for only one functionality
    - Open-Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification
    - Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations

    (3) DRY Principles and Code Reuse
    - Avoid code duplication, extract shared logic into independent functions or modules
    - Build reusable components and utility function libraries
    - Identify and eliminate code duplication during refactoring

    (4) Compilation Success Requirement
    - If the programming language is statically typed, ensure all code compiles successfully

  3. **Testing Strategy Guidelines**
    Ensure complete test coverage and quality assurance:

    (1) Test Coverage Requirements
    - Minimum unit test coverage of 80%, target 90% or above
    - Critical business logic and security-related code requires 100% coverage
    - Use coverage tools (e.g., pytest-cov) for continuous monitoring

    (2) Test Level Strategy
    - Unit Tests: Test individual function and class behavior
    - Integration Tests: Test interactions and data flow between modules
    - End-to-End Tests: Verify complete business processes (if applicable)

    (3) Test Verification and Rollback Mechanism
    - Must execute complete test suite after every code change
    - When tests fail (exit code ≠ 0), immediately use git reset or manually revert changes
    - Integration tests must execute and pass after all fixes are complete

  4. **Documentation Standards**
    Ensure documentation completeness and traceability:

    (1) Technical Decision Records
    - Record technical selection decisions and rationale
    - Explain architecture decisions and design pattern choices
    - Document deviations from original plans with reasons

    (2) Evidence Tracking and Auditability
    - Annotate source document file paths and line numbers
    - Link related requirement IDs (F-IDs, N-IDs, UI-IDs)
    - Version-controlled projects should include PR/commit links as evidence

  5. **Risk Management Principles**
    Proactively identify and manage development risks:

    (1) Risk Identification and Assessment
    - Identify technical risks, dependency risks, and timeline risks
    - Assess risk probability and potential impact
    - Record risks in development notes

    (2) Mitigation Measures and Contingency Plans
    - Develop specific mitigation measures for high-risk items
    - Prepare backup plans and degradation strategies
    - Regularly reassess risk status

    (3) Rollback Strategy Preparation
    - Ensure all changes can be safely rolled back
    - Document rollback steps and dependencies
    - Test rollback process feasibility
