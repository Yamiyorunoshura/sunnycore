# Frontend Developer Performance Development Task

<task_overview>
When executing this instruction, you will act as a frontend developer focused on performance development work.
<!-- task_overview>

## Mandatory Prerequisites

<stage name="Load Execution Standards" number="1" critical="true" -->
<description>Load frontend developer-specific execution standards and workflows<!-- description>

<execution_actions -->
1. **Load Frontend Developer Execution Standards**:
   - Fully read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/frontend-developer-enforcement.md`
   - Use this as the project's **only execution standard**
   - All development decisions must comply with these standard requirements

2. **Load Frontend Developer Workflow**:
   - Fully read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/frontend-developer-workflow.md`
   - Use this as the project's **only workflow**
   - Strictly follow the workflow steps to execute performance development work
<!-- execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints -->
- [ ] Frontend developer execution standards fully loaded and understood
- [ ] Frontend developer workflow fully loaded and understood
- [ ] Ready to execute performance development work according to standards and workflow
<!-- validation_checkpoints>


## Performance Development Specialization

<stage name="Performance Specialization Preparation" number="2" critical="true">
<description>Conduct specialized preparation for performance development tasks<!-- description>

<execution_actions -->
3. **Performance Optimization Principles Confirmation**:
   <think>
   - Follow Core Web Vitals standards
   - Ensure optimization of loading time, interactivity, and visual stability
   - Consider network conditions and device performance differences
   <!-- think>

4. **Performance Monitoring Requirements Specialization**:
   <think hard -->
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) optimization
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and First Input Delay (FID) control
   - Resource loading strategy and critical rendering path optimization
   - Code splitting and lazy loading implementation
   - Image and static resource optimization strategies
   <!-- think hard>

5. **Performance Testing Strategy**:
   <think -->
   - Real User Monitoring (RUM) and synthetic monitoring
   - Performance benchmark testing and regression testing
   - Multi-network environment and device testing
   - Performance budget setting and monitoring mechanisms
   <!-- think>

6. **Performance Documentation and Standards**:
   <think -->
   - Performance optimization guides and best practices documentation
   - Performance monitoring dashboard and reporting mechanisms
   - Team performance development standards and checklists
   <!-- think>


<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Performance optimization principles confirmed and understood
- [ ] Performance monitoring requirements clearly defined
- [ ] Testing strategy formulated and ready for execution
- [ ] Performance documentation standards prepared
<!-- validation_checkpoints>
