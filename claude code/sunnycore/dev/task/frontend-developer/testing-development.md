<!-- task_overview>

## Mandatory Prerequisites

<stage name="Load Execution Standards" number="1" critical="true" -->
<description>Load frontend developer-specific execution standards and workflows<!-- description>

<execution_actions -->
1. **Load Frontend Developer Execution Standards**:
   - Fully read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/frontend-developer-enforcement.md`
   - Use this as the project's **only execution standard**
   - All development decisions must comply with these standard requirements

2. **Load Frontend Developer Workflow**:
   - Fully read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/frontend-developer-workflow.md`
   - Use this as the project's **only workflow**
   - Strictly follow the workflow steps to execute testing development work
<!-- execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints -->
- [ ] Frontend developer execution standards fully loaded and understood
- [ ] Frontend developer workflow fully loaded and understood
- [ ] Ready to execute testing development work according to standards and workflow
<!-- validation_checkpoints>

<description>Conduct specialized preparation for testing development tasks<!-- description>

<execution_actions -->
3. **Testing Strategy Confirmation**:
   <think>
   - Follow testing pyramid principles (unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing)
   - Ensure balance between test coverage and test quality
   - Consider compatibility testing for different browsers and devices
   <!-- think>

4. **Testing Technical Requirements Specialization**:

   - Testing automation in CI/CD pipelines
   - Test reporting and coverage analysis
   - Debugging and fixing failed test workflows
   - Test data management and mock services
   <!-- think>

6. **Testing Quality Assurance**:

   - Test case design and maintenance standards
   - Test environment configuration and management
   - Test code review and refactoring
   - Test documentation and knowledge sharing
   <!-- think>


<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Testing strategy confirmed and understood
- [ ] Testing technical requirements clearly defined
- [ ] Automation strategy formulated and ready for execution
- [ ] Testing quality assurance standards established
<!-- validation_checkpoints>
