## Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

### 1. Enhanced Startup Sequence

#### SELF-DISCOVER Integration Pattern
```markdown
**Enhanced Startup Sequence with SELF-DISCOVER Framework**:

1. **Greeting with Reasoning Framework**: Character introduction with experience background
2. **SELF-DISCOVER Command Processing**:
   - **SELECT**: Analyze command type and select appropriate modules
   - **ADAPT**: Adjust strategy based on complexity and requirements
   - **IMPLEMENT**: Create structured execution plan
   - **APPLY**: Execute with continuous monitoring and validation
3. **Command Feedback with Structured Analysis**: XML-formatted response protocol
```

#### Template Implementation
```xml
<command_analysis>
<command_type>{command_name}</command_type>
<coordination_strategy>Multi-agent coordination approach</coordination_strategy>
<execution_plan>Structured execution steps with validation checkpoints</execution_plan>
</command_analysis>
```

### 2. Command Behavior Patterns

#### Systematic Command Processing
```markdown
**Execution Logic with SELF-DISCOVER Framework**:
1. **SELECT**: Choose appropriate coordination modules based on task complexity
2. **ADAPT**: Adjust coordination strategy for specific task requirements
3. **IMPLEMENT**: Create structured multi-agent coordination plan
4. **APPLY**: Execute coordination with continuous validation
```

#### XML Structured Output Framework
```xml
<{command_type}_coordination>
<task_analysis>Task requirements and complexity assessment</task_analysis>
<agent_coordination>Multi-agent collaboration strategy</agent_coordination>
<execution_plan>Structured execution steps</execution_plan>
<validation_checkpoints>Quality assurance and progress validation</validation_checkpoints>
</{command_type}_coordination>
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination Techniques

#### Synchronous Collaboration Framework
```xml
<enhanced_collaboration_flow>
<parallel_execution_phase>
  <agent name="agent1" coordination="structured">
    <responsibility>Specific task responsibility</responsibility>
    <output_format>XML structured output</output_format>
    <quality_gates>Validation checkpoints</quality_gates>
  </agent>
  <agent name="agent2" coordination="systematic">
    <responsibility>Parallel task responsibility</responsibility>
    <output_format>Structured format</output_format>
    <quality_gates>Completeness verification</quality_gates>
  </agent>
</parallel_execution_phase>
<sequential_execution_phase>
  <agent name="agent3" coordination="enhanced" depends_on="parallel_completion">
    <responsibility>Sequential task based on parallel results</responsibility>
    <output_format>Comprehensive structured output</output_format>
    <quality_gates>Final validation</quality_gates>
  </agent>
</sequential_execution_phase>
</enhanced_collaboration_flow>
```

#### Quality Checkpoints Integration
- **Document Generation Validation**: Format and content verification
- **Cross-Agent Consistency**: Output alignment across agents
- **Comprehensive Completeness Check**: Systematic deliverable verification

## Prompt Technique Integration

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Coordination
Applied throughout all command processing:

```markdown
**Problem Analysis**: "Let me first understand the core requirements..."
**Strategic Thinking**: "Next, I'll analyze the optimal coordination approach..."
**Execution Planning**: "Based on this analysis, I'll create a structured plan..."
**Validation**: "Finally, I'll ensure all deliverables meet quality standards..."
```

### 2. XML Structured Communication
Standard response format for all command interactions:

```xml
<coordination_response>
<analysis>Systematic analysis of task requirements and constraints</analysis>
<strategy>Multi-agent coordination strategy and approach</strategy>
<execution>Structured execution plan with clear responsibilities</execution>
<validation>Quality assurance and progress validation mechanisms</validation>
</coordination_response>
```
