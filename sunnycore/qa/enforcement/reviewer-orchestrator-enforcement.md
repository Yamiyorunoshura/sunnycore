## Parallel Review Execution Framework

<parallel_review_coordination>
**Parallel Review Coordination Protocol**:

### üöÄ Parallel Execution Specifications (Mandatory Compliance)
<mandatory_parallel_execution_rules>
**Mandatory Parallel Execution Rules**:

#### Rule 1: Simultaneous Launch Principle
- **MUST**: Call all relevant reviewers simultaneously in a single response
- **FORBIDDEN**: Sequential waiting calls (call one, wait, call next)
- **Implementation**: Use multiple @reviewer_agent calls in the same conversation

#### Rule 2: Responsibility Scope Division Principle  
- **MUST**: Clearly specify specific review focus areas for each reviewer
- **MUST**: Avoid responsibility overlap between reviewers
- **Examples**: 
  - code-quality ‚Üí Architecture design, coding standards
  - testing ‚Üí Test coverage, testing strategies
  - security ‚Üí Security vulnerabilities, access control

#### Rule 3: State Synchronization Principle
- **MUST**: All reviewers must start execution simultaneously
- **MUST**: Uniformly update start times in session state
- **MUST**: Real-time monitoring of all reviewers' progress status

#### Rule 4: Result Waiting Principle
- **MUST**: Wait for all reviewers to complete before result integration
- **FORBIDDEN**: Start integration upon partial completion
- **Exception Handling**: Single reviewer failure should not block other reviewers

#### Rule 5: Parallel Efficiency Optimization Principle
- **Target**: Achieve 3-5x time efficiency improvement
- **Measurement**: Monitor total execution time vs sequential execution time
- **Optimization**: Dynamically adjust reviewer combinations based on project type

- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve discrepancies between documented and actual behavior
- **Parallel Invocation Example**:
  ```
  @task-reviewer_documentation Review documentation completeness and accuracy
  @task-reviewer_integration Check system integration and API consistency
  ```

### üö® Parallel Execution Anti-pattern Detection
<parallel_execution_antipatterns>
**Prohibited Execution Patterns**:

#### ‚ùå Anti-pattern 1: Sequential Waiting Calls
```bad_example
// Wrong example - Sequential calling
@task-reviewer_code-quality Please review code quality first
// Wait for response...then call next one
@task-reviewer_testing Please review test coverage
```

#### ‚ùå Anti-pattern 2: Overlapping Responsibility Calls
```bad_example  
// Wrong example - Unclear responsibilities
@task-reviewer_code-quality Please comprehensively review all aspects
@task-reviewer_testing Please comprehensively review all aspects
```

#### ‚ùå Anti-pattern 3: Partial Parallel Execution
```bad_example
// Wrong example - Only partial parallel reviewers
@task-reviewer_code-quality and @task-reviewer_testing execute together
// Later call...
@task-reviewer_security Execute security review separately
```

#### ‚úÖ Correct Pattern: Complete Parallel Execution
```good_example
// Correct example - Call all relevant reviewers simultaneously
@task-reviewer_code-quality Focus on architecture and coding standards, avoid testing and security domains
@task-reviewer_testing Focus on test coverage and strategy, avoid code architecture
@task-reviewer_security Focus on security vulnerabilities and protection, avoid performance optimization
@task-reviewer_performance Focus on performance analysis and optimization, avoid security configuration
```

## üö® CRITICAL: Agent Separation Enforcement

### Strict Domain Separation Rules - NO EXCEPTIONS

<reviewer_domain_restriction>
**Reviewer Orchestrator Domain Restriction**:

#### ALLOWED Agent Calls
- **`task-reviewer_*`** - All reviewer agents within the review domain
  - `task-reviewer_code-quality`
  - `task-reviewer_testing`
  - `task-reviewer_security`
  - `task-reviewer_performance`
  - `task-reviewer_documentation`
  - `task-reviewer_integration`

#### FORBIDDEN Agent Calls
- **`backend-developer_*`** - All development agents are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- **`frontend-developer_*`** - All development agents are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- **`fullstack-developer_*`** - All development agents are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- **`refactor-developer_*`** - All development agents are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- Any agents outside the reviewer domain

#### File Access Rules
- **Reading development notes is ALLOWED** (e.g., `docs/dev-notes/{task_id}-dev-notes.md`)
- **Reading implementation plans is ALLOWED** (e.g., `docs/implementation-plan/{task_id}-plan.md`)
- **Calling development agents is FORBIDDEN**
- Review result reading and writing is the primary responsibility
</reviewer_domain_restriction>

### Architectural Principle Enforcement

<separation_rationale>
**Why This Separation Exists**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Review and development are distinct phases
- **Quality Assurance Independence**: Reviews must be independent of development bias
- **Workflow Integrity**: Maintains clear boundaries between development and quality assurance
- **Circular Dependency Prevention**: Prevents infinite loops and architectural violations
- **Authority Clarity**: Each orchestrator has specific responsibilities and authority
</separation_rationale>

### Violation Detection and Consequences

<violation_handling>
**Automatic Violation Detection**:
- Any call to `*-developer_*` agents from reviewer orchestrator is a critical violation
- System should immediately flag and halt execution
- Clear error messages should indicate the architectural violation

**Consequences of Violations**:
- **Immediate Workflow Halt**: System stops execution upon detection
- **Quality Assurance Compromise**: Violates the independence of review process
- **Circular Dependencies**: Can create infinite loops between orchestrators
- **Authority Confusion**: Blurs the line between development and review phases
- **Process Integrity Breach**: Compromises the intended quality assurance workflow
</violation_handling>
