## üîÑ Workflow Todo List Creation

### üìã Necessary Preparations Before Starting Execution

**Important Reminder**: Before starting execution of any workflow steps, you must use the todo list to create a todo list to organize these steps.

**Creation Process**:
1. **Analyze Workflow Structure** - Carefully read the entire workflow file, identify all phases, steps, and tasks
2. **Extract Key Tasks** - Convert core tasks of each phase into specific todo items
3. **Set Priorities** - Set priorities based on task importance and dependency relationships
4. **Create Todo List** - Use `todo_write` tool to create structured todo list containing all steps
5. **Execute and Update** - Execute tasks in todo list order, update status in a timely manner

### üìù Todo List Requirements
- **Coverage**: Each major phase should have corresponding todo items
- **Verification Points**: Critical validation checkpoints must be included in todo list
- **Priority**: Set reasonable priorities to ensure dependency relationships are respected
- **Status Management**: Update todo status in a timely manner during execution (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed)
- **Parallel Execution**: Support multiple tasks in `in_progress` status simultaneously to improve efficiency
- **Dependency Management**: Ensure tasks with dependencies execute in correct order
- **Completeness**: Only mark as `completed` when tasks are fully completed

## Core Workflow

<workflow_phases>

### Phase 1: Pre-Information Gathering and Verification
<phase name="information_gathering" complexity="think hard">

**Project Specifications Loading**
<task number="1" critical="true">
- **Description**: Read `{project_root}/docs/specs/` to obtain project information
- **Requirements**:
  <requirements>
  - Establish complete project context model
  - Understand project architecture, technical constraints, and business requirements
  </requirements>
</task>

**Task Specifications Parsing**
<task number="2" critical="true">
- **Description**: Read `{project_root}/docs/specs/task.md` to obtain detailed specifications for {task_id}(such as `1`, `2`, `3`...)
- **Requirements**:
  <requirements>
  - Deeply understand task scope, functional requirements, and acceptance criteria
  - Identify key technical challenges and risk factors
  </requirements>
</task>

**Implementation Plan Retrieval**
<task number="3" critical="true">
- **Description**: Read `{project_root}/docs/implementation-plan/{task_id}`(such as `1`, `2`, `3`...)-plan.md` to obtain implementation plan
- **Requirements**:
  <requirements>
  - Confirm plan completeness and technical feasibility
  - Verify consistency between plan and specifications
  </requirements>
</task>

</phase>

### Phase 2: Plan Compliance Validation
<phase name="compliance_validation" complexity="think">

**Specifications Consistency Check**
<validation_checkpoint critical="true">
- **Description**: Check if plan complies with specifications
- **Check Requirements**:
  <requirements>
  - Verify implementation plan covers all specification requirements
  - Confirm appropriateness of technical solutions
  - Check reasonableness of schedule arrangements
  </requirements>
- **Failure Handling**: If non-compliant, immediately stop review and report inconsistency issues
</validation_checkpoint>

</phase>

### Phase 3: Status Assessment and Review Strategy
<phase name="status_assessment" complexity="think hard">

**Brownfield Status Check**
<assessment_task>
- **Description**: Check if in brownfield state (has previous review documents)
- **Brownfield Handling Strategy**:
  <brownfield_strategy>
  - Prioritize review of whether previously identified issues have been resolved
  - Identify remediation quality and completeness
  - Then review if new issues have emerged
  - Track progress and effectiveness of issue resolution
  </brownfield_strategy>
</assessment_task>

</phase>

### Phase 4: Synchronized Review Execution
<phase name="parallel_review_execution" complexity="think harder">

**Multiple Reviewer Coordination**
<orchestration_task>
- **Description**: Based on plan and detailed specifications in task.md, synchronously call corresponding reviewers
- **Execution Requirements**:
  <requirements>
  - Select appropriate reviewer combinations based on task type
  - Ensure all review dimensions are covered
  - Wait for all reviewers to complete their reviews
  - Monitor review progress and quality
  </requirements>
</orchestration_task>

</phase>

### Phase 5: Result Integration and Report Generation
<phase name="result_integration" complexity="think hard">

**Review Result Integration**
<integration_task>
- **Description**: Integrate evaluation results from all reviewers
- **Integration Requirements**:
  <requirements>
  - Analyze findings and recommendations from each reviewer
  - Identify duplicate issues and conflicting suggestions
  - Evaluate problem priorities and impact levels
  - Generate unified review conclusions
  </requirements>
</integration_task>

**Review Report Generation**
<report_generation>
- **Template Loading**: Read `Users/tszkinlai/Coding/cursor-claude/core/qa/templates/review-tmpl.yaml`
  <template_requirements>
  - Ensure template format integrity
  - Understand semantics and requirements of each field
  </template_requirements>

- **Result Filling and Formatting**:
  <formatting_process>
  - Fill integrated results into corresponding positions in review-tmpl.yaml
  - Convert filled review results to markdown format
  - Save to `{project_root}/docs/review-results/{task_id}`(such as `1`, `2`, `3`...)-review.md`
  - If file with same name already exists, directly overwrite
  </formatting_process>

- **Output Quality Requirements**:
  <output_requirements>
  - Ensure readability and structure of markdown format
  - Maintain completeness and accuracy of review results
  - Provide clear problem descriptions and remediation recommendations
  </output_requirements>
</report_generation>

**Task Status Update**
<task_status_update>
- **Description**: Update task completion status in `{project_root}/docs/specs/task.md`
- **Update Rules**:
  <update_rules>
  - old_string: [ ] `{task_id}`(such as `1`, `2`, `3`...)
