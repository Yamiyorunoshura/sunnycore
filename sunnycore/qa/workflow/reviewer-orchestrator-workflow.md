## üîÑ Workflow Todo List Creation

### üìã Necessary Preparations Before Starting Execution

**Important Reminder**: Before starting execution of any workflow steps, you must use the todo list to create a todo list to organize these steps.

**Creation Process**:
1. **Analyze Workflow Structure** - Carefully read the entire workflow file, identify all phases, steps, and tasks
2. **Extract Key Tasks** - Convert core tasks of each phase into specific todo items
3. **Set Priorities** - Set priorities based on task importance and dependency relationships
4. **Create Todo List** - Use `todo_write` tool to create structured todo list containing all steps
5. **Execute and Update** - Execute tasks in todo list order, update status in a timely manner

### üìù Todo List Requirements
- **Coverage**: Each major phase should have corresponding todo items
- **Verification Points**: Critical validation checkpoints must be included in todo list
- **Priority**: Set reasonable priorities to ensure dependency relationships are respected
- **Status Management**: Update todo status in a timely manner during execution (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed)
- **Parallel Execution**: Support multiple tasks in `in_progress` status simultaneously to improve efficiency
- **Dependency Management**: Ensure tasks with dependencies execute in correct order
- **Completeness**: Only mark as `completed` when tasks are fully completed
