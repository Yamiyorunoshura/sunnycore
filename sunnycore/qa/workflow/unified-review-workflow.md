# Unified Review Workflow

<enforcement>
## üîÑ Workflow Todo List Creation

### üìã Necessary Preparations Before Starting Execution

**Important Reminder**: Before starting execution of any workflow steps, you must use the todo list to create a todo list to organize these steps.

**Creation Process**:
1. **Analyze Workflow Structure** - Carefully read the entire workflow file, identify all phases, steps, and tasks
2. **Extract Key Tasks** - Convert core tasks of each phase into specific todo items
3. **Set Priorities** - Set priorities based on task importance and dependency relationships
4. **Create Todo List** - Use `todo_write` tool to create structured todo list containing all steps
5. **Execute and Update** - Execute tasks in todo list order, update status in a timely manner

### üìù Todo List Requirements
- **Coverage**: Each major phase should have corresponding todo items
- **Verification Points**: Critical validation checkpoints must be included in todo list
- **Priority**: Set reasonable priorities to ensure dependency relationships are respected
- **Status Management**: Update todo status in a timely manner during execution (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed)
- **Limited Parallelism**: Maximum 2-3 tasks can be in `in_progress` status simultaneously (for independent review phases)
- **Completeness**: Only mark as `completed` when tasks are fully completed

   - Check reasonableness of resource allocation
   - Verify realism of schedule arrangements

- **Progress Milestones**: Update progress incrementally based on review completion (60%, 70%, 80%, 90%)
- **Error Handling**: Update status to "error" if critical issues block review progress
</state_management_phase_3>

**Review Strategy**:
4. Conduct comprehensive review of project according to your own assessment methods
   - **State Update**: Progress to 60% after review strategy determination

**Greenfield Project Review Focus**:
- Reasonableness of architecture design
- Adherence to code standards
- Test coverage and quality
- Documentation completeness
- Security considerations
- **State Update**: Progress incrementally (70%, 80%) based on review dimension completion

**Brownfield Project Review Focus**:
- Prioritize review of previously identified issue lists
  - Verify issue remediation status
  - Evaluate effectiveness of remediation solutions
  - Confirm no introduction of new side effects
- Conduct new issue identification and evaluation

6. **State-Managed Completion Protocol**
   <state_managed_completion>
   **Phase 6a: Pre-completion State Update**
   - Update reviewer status to "completing" in session state
   - Set progress_percentage to 95%
   - Generate preliminary report summary
   - Signal readiness to orchestrator via state update
   
   **Phase 6b: Orchestrator Acknowledgment**
   - Wait for orchestrator acknowledgment signal
   - Monitor session state for orchestrator response
   - Maintain "completing" status during wait period
   
   **Phase 6c: Final Completion**
   - Upon receiving orchestrator acknowledgment
   - Update status to "completed" in session state
   - Set progress_percentage to 100%
   - Record completion timestamp
   - Send final report to main agent
   - Terminate reviewer session gracefully
   
   **Note**: Remember that in this phase you as reviewer do not need to write review results to any files - the orchestrator handles final report generation.
   </state_managed_completion>

**üîÑ Orchestrator Parallel Coordination Guidance**
<orchestrator_parallel_coordination>
**Parallel Execution Responsibilities as a Called Reviewer**:

#### Execution Environment Awareness
- **Parallel Awareness**: Understand that you are one of multiple reviewers called in parallel by orchestrator
- **Responsibility Boundaries**: Strictly execute according to review focus specified by orchestrator, avoid overstepping
- **State Synchronization**: Timely update progress status to facilitate orchestrator monitoring and coordination

#### Parallel Execution Best Practices
1. **Rapid Startup**: Start execution immediately upon receiving call, don't wait for other reviewers
2. **Focused Execution**: Focus on assigned review dimensions, don't duplicate other reviewers' work
3. **Regular Heartbeat**: Update progress_percentage and last_heartbeat every 5-10 minutes
4. **Avoid Conflicts**: Don't attempt to read or modify resources that other reviewers might use

#### State Update Protocol
```yaml
# Standard state updates as parallel reviewer
reviewer_state_updates:
  startup:
    status: "registered" ‚Üí "starting" ‚Üí "in_progress"
    heartbeat_frequency: "every_5_minutes"
    
  progress_reporting:
    progress_percentage: # Update based on actual completion 0-95%
    current_phase: # Current execution phase
    
  completion_signaling:
    pre_completion: # status: "completing", progress: 95%
    final_completion: # status: "completed", progress: 100%
```

#### Exception Handling
- **Autonomous Recovery**: Attempt autonomous recovery when encountering non-fatal errors, don't affect other reviewers
- **Failure Isolation**: If termination is necessary, ensure errors don't propagate to other parallel reviewers
- **Status Reporting**: Timely report error status to allow orchestrator to adjust coordination strategy
