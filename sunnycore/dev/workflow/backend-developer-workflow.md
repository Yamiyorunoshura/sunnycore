# Backend Developer Workflow

## üîÑ Workflow Todo List Creation

### üìã Necessary Preparations Before Starting Execution

**Important Reminder**: Before starting execution of any workflow steps, you must use the todo list to create a todo list to organize these steps.

**Creation Process**:
1. **Analyze Workflow Structure** - Carefully read the entire workflow file, identify all stages, steps, and tasks
2. **Extract Key Tasks** - Convert core tasks of each stage into specific todo items
3. **Set Priorities** - Set priorities based on task importance and dependency relationships
4. **Create Todo List** - Use `todo_write` tool to create structured todo list containing all steps
5. **Execute and Update** - Execute tasks in todo list order, update status in a timely manner

### üìù Todo List Requirements
- **Coverage**: Each major stage should have corresponding todo items
- **Verification Points**: Key verification checkpoints must be included in the todo list
- **Priorities**: Set reasonable priorities to ensure dependency relationships are respected
- **Status Management**: Update todo status in a timely manner during execution (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed)
- **Uniqueness**: Only one task can be in `in_progress` status at a time
- **Completeness**: Only mark as `completed` when the task is fully completed

## Mandatory Preconditions Verification
<mandatory-preconditions>

### 1. Load Execution Standards

<stage name="Load Execution Standards" number="1" critical="true">
**Mandatory Execution Standards Loading**
- **Description**: Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/backend-developer-enforcement.md`
- **Requirements**:
  <requirements>
  - Understand all mandatory rules, security requirements, and quality gates
  - If unable to load, immediately stop and report error
  </requirements>

</stage>

### 2. Project Context Establishment

<stage name="Project Context Establishment" number="2" critical="true">

**Project Specifications Understanding**

- **Description**: Read all documents under the `{project_root}/docs/specs/` path
- **Requirements**:
  <requirements>
  <think>
  Backend developers need to focus on the following types of project specification content:

  1. **System Architecture Specifications**:
     - Microservices architecture design
     - Database design and relational models
     - API interface design and communication protocols
     - System integration points and external dependencies

  2. **Security Specifications**:
     - Authentication and authorization strategies
     - Data encryption and privacy protection requirements
     - API security standards and rate limiting
     - Security vulnerability protection mechanisms

  3. **Performance and Scalability Specifications**:
     - Performance metrics and benchmarking requirements
     - Load handling and scaling strategies
     - Caching strategies and data optimization
     - Monitoring and logging requirements

  4. **Data Management Specifications**:
     - Data models and structure design
     - Data migration and versioning strategies
     - Backup and disaster recovery plans
     - Data integrity and consistency requirements

  5. **Business Logic Specifications**:
     - Core business processes and rules
     - Transaction processing and state management
     - Error handling and exception management
     - Business validation rules
  </think>

  Based on the above thinking analysis, execute the following tasks:
  - Understand project requirements, architecture design, technical constraints
  - Establish a complete project context model
  - Identify key dependencies and security requirements
  - Pay special attention to backend systems' data flow, API design, and security architecture
  - Confirm performance benchmarks and scalability strategies
  </requirements>

**Implementation Plan Verification**
- **Description**: Confirm `{project_root}/docs/implementation-plan/{task_id}`(such as `1`, `2`, `3`...)-plan.md` exists and is readable
<critical-checkpoint>
If implementation plan does not exist, immediately stop and notify user that planning stage needs to be executed first
</critical-checkpoint>

- **Requirements**:
  <requirements>
  <think hard>
  - Validate plan completeness, scope definition, and technical feasibility
  - Confirm security requirements and performance targets
  <think hard>
  </requirements>

</stage>

### 3. Backend Specialization Preparation

<stage name="Backend Specialization Preparation" number="3" critical="true">
**Security Checklist Preparation**
Prepare security checklist according to mandatory execution standards:

<security-checklist>
<think>
- [ ] Input validation strategy
- [ ] Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] Data encryption and sensitive information handling
- [ ] API security design
<think>
</security-checklist>

**Performance Targets Confirmation**
Confirm and record performance requirements:
<performance-targets>
<think>
- Latency targets and throughput requirements
- Memory usage limits
- Monitoring and measurement strategies
<think>
</performance-targets>
</stage>
</mandatory-preconditions>

## Execution Protocol
<execution-protocol>

### TDD Development Process
<stage name="TDD Development Process" number="4" critical="true">

#### Test-First Development
Strictly follow TDD principles:
<tdd-requirements>
<think harder>
- **Write tests before implementation**
- **Ensure test coverage meets required thresholds**
- **Implement unit tests, integration tests, and contract tests**
<think harder>
</tdd-requirements>

#### Architecture Principles Application
Apply the following principles during development:
<architecture-principles>
<think harder>
1. **SOLID design principles**
2. **Clean architecture and separation of concerns**
3. **Error handling and logging mechanisms**
<think harder>
</architecture-principles>
</stage>

### Quality Assurance
<stage name="Quality Assurance" number="5" critical="true">
#### Continuous Validation
Continuously execute during development:
<quality-validations>
<think hard>
- **Static analysis checks**
- **Security vulnerability scanning**
- **Performance benchmarking**
- **Backward compatibility verification**
<think hard>
</quality-validations>
</stage>
</execution-protocol>

## Failure Handling Mechanism
<failure-handling>
| Failure Scenario | Handling Action |
|---------|---------|
| **Precondition Failure** | Immediately stop, report specific missing files or conditions |
| **Plan Missing** | Stop development, guide user to execute planning stage first |
| **Security Check Failed** | Record risks and require fixes before continuing |
| **Performance Not Met** | Record measurement results and formulate optimization plan |

<critical-failures>
**Any critical failure must immediately stop the process and report**
</critical-failures>

</failure-handling>

</workflow>
