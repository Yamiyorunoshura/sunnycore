# Developer Orchestrator Workflow

## üîÑ Workflow Todo List Creation

### üìã Necessary Preparations Before Starting Execution

**Important Reminder**: Before starting execution of any workflow steps, you must use the todo list to create a todo list to organize these steps.

**Creation Process**:
1. **Analyze Workflow Structure** - Carefully read the entire workflow file, identify all stages, steps, and tasks
2. **Extract Key Tasks** - Convert core tasks of each stage into specific todo items
3. **Set Priorities** - Set priorities based on task importance and dependency relationships
4. **Create Todo List** - Use `todo_write` tool to create structured todo list containing all steps
5. **Execute and Update** - Execute tasks in todo list order, update status in a timely manner

### üìù Todo List Requirements
- **Coverage**: Each major stage should have corresponding todo items
- **Verification Points**: Key verification checkpoints must be included in the todo list
- **Priorities**: Set reasonable priorities to ensure dependency relationships are respected
- **Status Management**: Update todo status in a timely manner during execution (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed)
- **Parallel Execution**: Support multiple tasks in `in_progress` status simultaneously to improve efficiency
- **Dependency Management**: Ensure tasks with dependencies execute in correct order
- **Completeness**: Only mark as `completed` when the task is fully completed

<stage name="Plan Verification Phase" number="1">
<description>Check and verify the existence and completeness of implementation plans</description>

<execution_actions>
- Read the implementation plan corresponding to task_id from `{project_root}/docs/implementation-plan/{task_id}`(such as `1`, `2`, `3`...)-plan.md` (such as `1-plan.md`, `2-plan.md`, `3-plan.md`...)
- Validate plan format and required fields (metadata, scope, assumptions, constraints)
- Confirm plan scope and constraints
- Verify resolvability of sources paths
</execution_actions>

<stage name="Task Classification Phase" number="2">
<description>Analyze plan content and classify task types and technical domains</description>

<think harder>
<execution_actions>
- Deeply analyze technical domains and complexity involved in plan content
- Intelligently identify frontend, backend, fullstack, or refactoring requirements
- Evaluate inter-task dependencies and synchronous execution possibilities
- Calculate task complexity and required resource estimation
- Check if `docs/review-results/{task_id}-review.md` (such as `1-review.md`, `2-review.md`, `3-review.md`...) exists for previous review documents (brownfield state detection)
- If in brownfield state, read the issue list, repair recommendations, and priorities from `docs/review-results/{task_id}-review.md` (such as `1-review.md`, `2-review.md`, `3-review.md`...) and use them as reference for task classification.

<stage name="Agent Assignment Phase" number="3">

<think harder>
<execution_actions>
- Select the most appropriate sub-agent based on task type mapping rules in `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/developer-orchestrator-enforcement.md`
- Initiate synchronous execution protocol (when there are no strong dependencies between tasks)
