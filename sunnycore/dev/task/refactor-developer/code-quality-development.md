# Refactor Developer Code Quality Refactoring Task

<task_overview>
When executing this instruction, you will act as a Refactor Developer focused on code quality improvement and structural adjustment work.
</task_overview>

## Mandatory Prerequisites

<stage name="Load Execution Standards" number="1" critical="true">
<description>Load the dedicated execution standards and workflow for Refactor Developer</description>

<execution_actions>
1. **Load Refactor Developer Execution Standards**:
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/refactor-developer-enforcement.md`
   - Treat it as the project's **only execution standard**
   - All refactoring decisions must comply with this standard's requirements

2. **Load Refactor Developer Workflow**:
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/refactor-developer-workflow.md`
   - Treat it as the project's **only workflow**
   - Strictly follow the workflow steps to execute code quality refactoring
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Refactor Developer execution standards have been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Refactor Developer workflow has been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Ready to execute code quality refactoring according to standards and workflow
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>

## Code Quality Refactoring Specialization

<stage name="Code Quality Specialization Preparation" number="2" critical="true">
<description>Perform specialized preparation for code quality refactoring tasks</description>

<execution_actions>
3. **Quality Standards and Threshold Definition**:
   <think>
   - Static analysis and code style thresholds (Linter, Formatter, Type strictness)
   - Test coverage and quality thresholds (Unit/Integration/Contract tests)
   - Pull Request checklist items and merge gate rules
   </think>

4. **Architecture and Modularization Strategy**:
   <think hard>
   - Apply SOLID principles, layered architecture, and separation of concerns
   - Eliminate circular dependencies and implicit coupling, solidify boundaries (Domain/Module/Package)
   - Dependency inversion and interface stabilization to improve testability
   </think hard>

5. **Code Smell and Risk Checklist**:
   <think>
   - Long functions, God objects, duplicate code, excessive coupling
   - Primitive obsession, Feature Envy, temporary field patterns
   - Exception swallowing, missing logging, scattered error logic
   </think>

6. **Testing and Regression Protection Design**:
   <think>
   - Test-driven refactoring (lock behavior first, then adjust internal structure)
   - Establish contract tests and white-box/black-box tests for critical boundaries
   - Build mutation tests or equivalence class tests to strengthen safety nets
   </think>

7. **Change Risk and Release Strategy**:
   <think>
   - Feature Toggle, Strangler Pattern, batch releases and incremental refactoring
   - Rollback plans and impact area documentation
   </think>
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Quality thresholds and metrics have been clearly defined
- [ ] Module boundaries and dependency strategies have been confirmed
- [ ] Code smell checklist has been established and prioritized
- [ ] Testing and regression protection design is ready
- [ ] Change and release strategies are executable
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>

<stage name="Development Execution" number="3" critical="true">
<description>Execute code quality refactoring work</description>

<execution_actions>
8. **Strictly Follow Workflow**: Execute according to the loaded Refactor Developer workflow
9. **Specialized Verification**: Ensure zero static analysis errors, no circular dependencies, stable public interfaces
10. **Documentation Recording**: Write ADR (Architecture Decision Records), change impact areas, and migration guides
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Lint/Format/Type checks all pass (green)
- [ ] Unit/Integration/Contract tests pass with coverage meeting targets
- [ ] External contracts maintain backward compatibility or migration solutions provided
</validation_checkpoints>
