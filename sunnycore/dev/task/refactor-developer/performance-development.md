# Refactor Developer Performance Optimization Refactoring Task

<task_overview>
When executing this instruction, you will act as a Refactor Developer focused on performance profiling, bottleneck removal, and system stability improvement work.
</task_overview>

## Mandatory Prerequisites

<stage name="Load Execution Standards" number="1" critical="true">
<description>Load the dedicated execution standards and workflow for Refactor Developer</description>

<execution_actions>
1. **Load Refactor Developer Execution Standards**:
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/refactor-developer-enforcement.md`
   - Treat it as the project's **only execution standard**
   - All refactoring decisions must comply with this standard's requirements

2. **Load Refactor Developer Workflow**:
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/refactor-developer-workflow.md`
   - Treat it as the project's **only workflow**
   - Strictly follow the workflow steps to execute performance optimization refactoring
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Refactor Developer execution standards have been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Refactor Developer workflow has been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Ready to execute performance optimization refactoring according to standards and workflow
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>

## Performance Optimization Refactoring Specialization

<stage name="Performance Specialization Preparation" number="2" critical="true">
<description>Perform specialized preparation for performance optimization refactoring tasks</description>

<execution_actions>
3. **Performance Goals and SLO Definition**:
   <think>
   - Latency P50/P95/P99, throughput, error rate, and resource utilization targets
   - Service Level Objectives (SLO) and Service Level Indicators (SLI)
   - Monitoring and benchmarking methods (load, stress, capacity)
   </think>

4. **Profiling and Observability Strategy**:
   <think hard>
   - End-to-end Tracing, Metrics, and Logs three pillars
   - Collect slow queries, GC, lock contention, I/O waits, and network latency
   - Establish profiling reports and heatmaps for critical transaction paths
   </think hard>

5. **Bottleneck Identification and Optimization Path**:
   <think>
   - Algorithm complexity, data structures, and memory allocation
   - Database access (indexing, query plans, N+1, batching)
   - Caching hierarchy (local/distributed), TTL, invalidation strategies, and consistency
   - Concurrency and asynchronous models, backpressure, and scheduling strategies
   </think>

6. **Architecture-level Optimization Strategy**:
   <think>
   - Isolate critical paths (CQRS, read-write separation, event-driven)
   - Sharding, partitioning, and data hotspot mitigation
   - Service degradation, circuit breaker, retry, timeout, and overload protection
   </think>

7. **Release and Risk Control**:
   <think>
   - Canary releases, gradual rollout, A/B testing with comparative metrics
   - Rollback plans and impact assessments with clear capacity plans
   </think>
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] SLO/SLI and performance goals have been defined
- [ ] Observability covers critical paths and can reproduce issues
- [ ] Bottleneck checklist and optimization sequence have been established
- [ ] Release and rollback strategies have been prepared
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>

<stage name="Development Execution" number="3" critical="true">
<description>Execute performance optimization refactoring work</description>

<execution_actions>
8. **Strictly Follow Workflow**: Execute according to the loaded Refactor Developer workflow
9. **Specialized Verification**: Validate benefits and regressions of each change with benchmark tests
10. **Documentation Recording**: Preserve profiling reports, performance measurements, tuning rationale, and result comparisons
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Benchmark tests are reproducible and statistically significant (multiple measurements with converging intervals)
- [ ] End-to-end latency/throughput/resource metrics meet targets
- [ ] Failure rate has not increased and stability has not decreased
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>
