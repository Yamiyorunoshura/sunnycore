# Fullstack Developer Performance Development Task

<task_overview>
When executing this instruction, you will act as a fullstack developer focused on performance development work, responsible for frontend and backend performance optimization, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
</task_overview>

## Mandatory Prerequisites

<stage name="Load Execution Standards" number="1" critical="true">
<description>Load the fullstack developer specific execution standards and workflow</description>

<execution_actions>
1. **Load Fullstack Developer Execution Standards**：
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/fullstack-developer-enforcement.md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only execution standard**
   - All performance decisions must comply with this standard's requirements

2. **Load Fullstack Developer Workflow**：
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/fullstack-developer-workflow..md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only workflow**
   - Strictly follow the workflow steps to execute performance development work
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Fullstack developer execution standards have been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Fullstack developer workflow has been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Ready to execute performance development work according to standards and workflow
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>

## Performance Development Specialization

<stage name="Performance Specialization Preparation" number="2" critical="true">
<description>Conduct specialized preparation for performance development tasks</description>

<execution_actions>
3. **Frontend Performance Metrics Confirmation**：
   <think hard>
   - Confirm Core Web Vitals metric targets (LCP, INP, TTI)
   - Analyze frontend loading performance and rendering performance requirements
   - Formulate resource optimization strategies (JavaScript, CSS, images)
   - Design frontend caching and CDN strategies
   </think hard>

4. **Backend Performance Targets Formulation**：
   <think hard>
   - Define API response time and throughput targets
   - Analyze database query performance and optimization opportunities
   - Design backend resource usage and memory management
   - Plan asynchronous processing and concurrency control strategies
   </think hard>

5. **End-to-End Performance Monitoring**：
   <think hard>
   - Design unified performance monitoring architecture
   - Plan frontend and backend metrics collection
   - Design performance anomaly detection and alerting mechanisms
   - Formulate performance trend analysis and prediction models
   </think hard>

6. **Optimization Strategy Planning**：
   <think>
   - Design frontend optimization techniques (code splitting, lazy loading, preloading)
   - Plan backend optimization techniques (caching, indexing, connection pooling)
   - Design network optimization strategies (compression, HTTP/2, WebSocket)
   - Formulate database performance optimization plans
   </think>

7. **Performance Testing and Benchmarks**：
   <think>
   - Design performance testing scenarios and benchmark tests
   - Plan load testing and stress testing strategies
   - Design A/B testing and performance comparison mechanisms
   - Formulate continuous performance monitoring and regression testing
   </think>
