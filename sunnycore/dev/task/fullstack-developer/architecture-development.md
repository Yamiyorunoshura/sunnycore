# Fullstack Developer Architecture Development Task

<task_overview>
When executing this instruction, you will act as a fullstack developer focused on architecture development work, simultaneously responsible for frontend and backend architecture design and integration.
</task_overview>

## Mandatory Prerequisites

<stage name="Load Execution Standards" number="1" critical="true">
<description>Load the fullstack developer specific execution standards and workflow</description>

<execution_actions>
1. **Load Fullstack Developer Execution Standards**：
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/fullstack-developer-enforcement.md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only execution standard**
   - All architecture decisions must comply with this standard's requirements

2. **Load Fullstack Developer Workflow**：
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/fullstack-developer-workflow..md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only workflow**
   - Strictly follow the workflow steps to execute architecture development work
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Fullstack developer execution standards have been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Fullstack developer workflow has been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Ready to execute architecture development work according to standards and workflow
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>

## Architecture Development Specialization

<stage name="Architecture Specialization Preparation" number="2" critical="true">
<description>Conduct specialized preparation for architecture development tasks</description>

<execution_actions>
3. **Fullstack Architecture Principles Confirmation**：
   <think hard>
   - Ensure clear separation of concerns and responsibilities in frontend and backend architecture
   - Apply SOLID principles in both frontend and backend architecture design
   - Design architecture patterns that support scalability and maintainability
   - Ensure coordinated consistency in cross-layer technology selections
   </think hard>

4. **End-to-End Consistency Strategy Formulation**：
   <think hard>
   - Design unified data models and type definitions
   - Formulate API contract consistency strategies
   - Plan frontend-backend state synchronization mechanisms
   - Design unified error handling and logging strategies
   </think hard>

5. **Security Architecture Design**：
   <think hard>
   - Design multi-layer security architecture (frontend, API, database)
   - Plan unified authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Design data encryption and secure transmission strategies
   - Formulate security monitoring and incident response mechanisms
   </think hard>

6. **Performance Architecture Planning**：
   <think>
   - Design frontend performance optimization architecture (loading, rendering, interaction)
   - Plan backend performance targets (response time, throughput, resource usage)
   - Design database performance optimization strategies
   - Plan monitoring and observability architecture
   </think>

7. **Deployment and DevOps Architecture**：
   <think>
   - Design CI/CD processes and deployment strategies
   - Plan environment configuration and infrastructure architecture
   - Design scalability and high availability architecture
   - Formulate version management and rollback strategies
   </think>
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Fullstack architecture principles have been confirmed and understood
- [ ] End-to-end consistency strategy has been formulated
- [ ] Security architecture design has been completed
- [ ] Performance architecture planning has been formulated
- [ ] Deployment and DevOps architecture has been designed
</validation_checkpoints>
