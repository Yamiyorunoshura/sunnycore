# Fullstack Developer DevOps Development Task

<task_overview>
When executing this instruction, you will act as a fullstack developer focused on DevOps development work, responsible for frontend and backend deployment, monitoring, CI/CD, and infrastructure management.
</task_overview>

## Mandatory Prerequisites

<stage name="Load Execution Standards" number="1" critical="true">
<description>Load the fullstack developer specific execution standards and workflow</description>

<execution_actions>
1. **Load Fullstack Developer Execution Standards**：
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/fullstack-developer-enforcement.md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only execution standard**
   - All DevOps decisions must comply with this standard's requirements

2. **Load Fullstack Developer Workflow**：
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/fullstack-developer-workflow..md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only workflow**
   - Strictly follow the workflow steps to execute DevOps development work
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Fullstack developer execution standards have been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Fullstack developer workflow has been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Ready to execute DevOps development work according to standards and workflow
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>
