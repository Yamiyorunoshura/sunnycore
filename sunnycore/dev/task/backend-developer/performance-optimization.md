# Backend Developer Performance Optimization Task

<task_overview>
When executing this instruction, you will act as a backend developer focused on system performance optimization work.
</task_overview>

## Mandatory Prerequisites

<stage name="Load Enforcement Rules" number="1" critical="true">
<description>Load backend developer specific enforcement rules and workflow</description>

<execution_actions>
1. **Load Backend Developer Enforcement Rules**:
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/backend-developer-enforcement.md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only enforcement rules**
   - All performance optimization decisions must comply with these rule requirements

2. **Load Backend Developer Workflow**:
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/backend-developer-workflow.md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only workflow**
   - Strictly follow workflow steps to execute performance optimization work
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Backend developer enforcement rules have been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Backend developer workflow has been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Ready to execute performance optimization work according to rules and workflow
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>

## Performance Optimization Specialization

<stage name="Performance Optimization Specialization Preparation" number="2" critical="true">
<description>Conduct specialized preparation for performance optimization tasks</description>

<execution_actions>
3. **Performance Baseline Establishment**:
   <think>
   - Establish current system performance baseline
   - Determine key performance indicators (KPIs)
   - Set performance optimization goals and thresholds
   </think>

4. **Performance Bottleneck Identification**:
   <think hard>
   - CPU utilization and memory consumption analysis
   - I/O operations and database query performance
   - Network latency and bandwidth usage
   - Concurrent processing capacity assessment
   </think hard>

5. **Optimization Strategy Planning**:
   <think>
   - Code-level optimization (algorithms, data structures)
   - Database query optimization and indexing strategies
   - Caching mechanism design and implementation
   - Load balancing and distributed architecture
   </think>

6. **Monitoring and Measurement Tools**:
   <think>
   - Performance monitoring tool setup and configuration
   - Stress testing and load testing environments
   - Real-time performance dashboard creation
   - Alerting mechanisms and automated responses
   </think>
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Performance baseline has been established and recorded
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks have been identified and analyzed
- [ ] Optimization strategy has been planned and validated
- [ ] Monitoring and measurement tools have been prepared
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>

<stage name="Development Execution" number="3" critical="true">
<description>Execute performance optimization work</description>

<execution_actions>
7. **Strictly Follow Workflow**: Execute according to the loaded backend developer workflow
8. **Specialized Verification**: Ensure all performance optimization measures comply with security and stability requirements
9. **Documentation Recording**: Detail record optimization process, performance improvement results, and monitoring configuration
</execution_actions>
</stage>
