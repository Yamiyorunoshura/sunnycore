<task_overview>
When executing this instruction, you will act as a backend developer focused on infrastructure development work.
</task_overview>

## Mandatory Prerequisites

<stage name="Load Enforcement Rules" number="1" critical="true">
<description>Load backend developer specific enforcement rules and workflow</description>

<execution_actions>
1. **Load Backend Developer Enforcement Rules**:
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/backend-developer-enforcement.md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only enforcement rules**
   - All development decisions must comply with these rule requirements

2. **Load Backend Developer Workflow**:
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/backend-developer-workflow.md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only workflow**
   - Strictly follow workflow steps to execute infrastructure development work
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Backend developer enforcement rules have been completely loaded and understood
