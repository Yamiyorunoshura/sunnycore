</task_overview>

## Mandatory Prerequisites

<stage name="Load Enforcement Rules" number="1" critical="true">
<description>Load backend developer specific enforcement rules and workflow</description>

<execution_actions>
1. **Load Backend Developer Enforcement Rules**:
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/enforcement/backend-developer-enforcement.md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only enforcement rules**
   - All development decisions must comply with these rule requirements

2. **Load Backend Developer Workflow**:
   - Completely read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/backend-developer-workflow.md`
   - Treat this as the project's **only workflow**
   - Strictly follow workflow steps to execute API development work
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] Backend developer enforcement rules have been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Backend developer workflow has been completely loaded and understood
- [ ] Ready to execute API development work according to rules and workflow
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>

## API Development Specialization

<stage name="API Specialization Preparation" number="2" critical="true">
<description>Conduct specialized preparation for API development tasks</description>

<execution_actions>
3. **API Design Principles Confirmation**:
   <think>
   - Follow RESTful design principles and HTTP standards
   - Ensure API interface consistency and scalability
   - Consider version control and backward compatibility strategies
   </think>

4. **API Security Requirements Specialization**:
   <think hard>
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms (JWT, OAuth2, etc.)
   - Input validation and parameter sanitization
   - Rate limiting and DDoS protection
   - CORS policies and security headers configuration
   </think hard>

5. **API Performance Monitoring Strategy**:
   <think>
   - Response time and throughput monitoring
   - Error rate and availability tracking
   - API usage analytics and performance optimization
   - Load testing and stress testing planning
   </think>

6. **API Documentation and Specifications**:
   <think>
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specification documentation
   - Request/response examples and error code definitions
   - API usage guides and best practices
   </think>
</execution_actions>

<validation_checkpoints>
- [ ] API design principles have been confirmed and understood
- [ ] API security requirements have been clearly defined
- [ ] Performance monitoring strategy has been formulated
- [ ] API documentation specifications have been prepared
</validation_checkpoints>
</stage>

<stage name="Development Execution" number="3" critical="true">
<description>Execute API development work</description>

<execution_actions>
7. **Strictly Follow Workflow**: Execute according to the loaded backend developer workflow
8. **Specialized Verification**: Ensure all API-related security and performance requirements are satisfied
9. **Documentation Recording**: Detail record API architecture, query optimization, and security measures
</execution_actions>
</stage>
