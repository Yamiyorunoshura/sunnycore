## Core Execution Protocol

<prerequisite_conditions>
### Necessary Prerequisites (Relaxed)
- **Recommendation**: Load unified workflow and plan before starting; if missing, record in dev_notes.validation_warnings and continue
- **Workflow Reading**: Should read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/refactor-developer-workflow.md`, record warning if failed
