# Fullstack Developer Enforcement Standards

<core_execution_protocol>
## Core Execution Protocol

<mandatory_prerequisites>
### Mandatory Prerequisites (Relaxed)
- **Recommendation**: Load unified workflow and implementation plans before starting; if missing, record in dev_notes.validation_warnings and continue
- **Workflow Reading**: Should read `{project_root}/sunnycore/dev/workflow/fullstack-developer-workflow.md`, record warning if failed
