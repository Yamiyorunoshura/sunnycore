## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Agent Separation Enforcement

### Strict Domain Separation Rules - NO EXCEPTIONS

<developer_domain_restriction>
**Developer Orchestrator Domain Restriction**:

#### ALLOWED Agent Calls
- **`backend-developer_*`** - All backend development agents
- **`frontend-developer_*`** - All frontend development agents  
- **`fullstack-developer_*`** - All fullstack development agents
- **`refactor-developer_*`** - All refactoring development agents

#### FORBIDDEN Agent Calls
- **`task-reviewer_*`** - All reviewer agents are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- Any agents outside the developer domain

#### File Access Rules
- **Reading review result files is ALLOWED** (e.g., `docs/review-results/{task_id}-review.md`)
- **Calling reviewer agents is FORBIDDEN**
- Development notes reading and writing is encouraged
</developer_domain_restriction>

### Architectural Principle Enforcement

<separation_rationale>
**Why This Separation Exists**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Development and review are distinct phases
- **Workflow Integrity**: Maintains clear boundaries between development and quality assurance
- **Circular Dependency Prevention**: Prevents infinite loops and architectural violations
- **Role Clarity**: Each orchestrator has specific responsibilities and authority
</separation_rationale>

### Violation Detection and Consequences

<violation_handling>
**Automatic Violation Detection**:
- Any call to `task-reviewer_*` from developer orchestrator is a critical violation
- System should immediately flag and halt execution
- Clear error messages should indicate the architectural violation

**Consequences of Violations**:
- **Immediate Workflow Halt**: System stops execution upon detection
- **Architectural Integrity Breach**: Violates the intended separation of concerns
- **Circular Dependencies**: Can create infinite loops between orchestrators
