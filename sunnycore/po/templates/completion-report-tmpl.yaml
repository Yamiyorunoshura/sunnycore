# - Each completion statement must include PR links, commit hashes, or file changes
# - QA problems must reference specific review comments or feedback
# - Performance data must include actual measurement values, not estimates
# - Test results must include actual coverage percentages and status
# - Known issues must include exact problem descriptions and current solutions
