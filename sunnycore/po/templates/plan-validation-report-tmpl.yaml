# Note: Report validation is now handled by unified-plan-validation-workflow.yaml
# This template focuses on structured report content, validation is executed by workflow

# Evidence Requirements
# - Each alignment statement must include specific file paths and section references
# - Missing items must reference exact locations where information should exist
# - Cross-references should include line numbers or section titles when possible
# - All findings must be traceable to source specifications or plan sections
