# Project Concluder Enforcement Specification

## Core Execution Protocol

### Prerequisites (Flexible)
- **Recommendation**: Load necessary files before starting conclusion; record to validation_warnings if missing and continue
- **Recommended Reading Order**:
  1. `{project_root}/sunnycore/po/workflow/unified-project-concluding-workflow.yaml`
  2. `{project_root}/sunnycore/po/templates/completion-report-tmpl.yaml`
- **File Loading Verification**: Record gaps and alternative information sources if unable to load completely

### Determinism and Synchronization (New Mandatory)
- **Determinism**: All automated steps must be executed with temperature 0, top_p 1, seed 42
- **Consistency**: List output adopts stable lexicographic order, and all paths are normalized to absolute paths
- **Synchronization**: Allow sub-steps in `evidence_collection` and `delivery_synthesis` stages to execute synchronously, ensuring data dependencies are not broken
- **Fail-fast Strategy**: If prerequisites or essential files are missing, must stop immediately and report, not continue to subsequent stages
- **Cache Requirements**: Adopt content hash caching; reuse results when `docs/specs/**` and `docs/implementation-plan/**` have no changes

### Evidence-based Conclusion (Absolute Mandatory)
- **Evidence Requirements**: All conclusions must be supported by concrete evidence
- **Evidence Types**: File paths, PR links, test reports, measurement results, QA comments
- **Traceability**: Every completion statement must be traceable to concrete implementation evidence
- **Objectivity**: Avoid subjective judgments, base only on verifiable facts

### Workflow Compliance (Flexible)
- **Stage Integrity**: Should execute in order; record reasons and remediation plans when incomplete
- **Validation Checkpoints**: Record warnings and minimize continuation when not passed
- **Failure Handling**: Record warnings and continue for non-blocking failures; stop only for blocking failures

### Template Compliance (Mandatory Enforcement)
- **Structure Consistency**: Report must conform to `{project_root}/sunnycore/po/templates/completion-report-tmpl.yaml` structure

### Markdown Format Conversion (Absolute Mandatory)
- **YAML to Markdown**: Must completely convert `completion-report-tmpl.yaml` structure to standard Markdown format
- **Heading Hierarchy**: YAML sections converted to corresponding Markdown headings (# ## ### #### ##### ######)
- **List Format**: YAML arrays converted to Markdown lists (- or 1. format)
- **Code Blocks**: Code snippets, configurations, test results use standard Markdown code blocks (```language)
- **Table Format**: Completion status, QA results, performance data use Markdown table format | Field | Value |
- **Link Format**: PR links, document references use standard Markdown link format [text](URL)
- **Block Quotes**: Important discoveries, risk warnings use > quote format
- **Emphasis Markers**: Use **bold** and *italic* to appropriately emphasize key achievements and risks
- **Status Indicators**: Use emojis to clearly indicate completion status (‚úÖ Completed, ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially completed, ‚ùå Not completed, üîÑ In progress)

### Scope Compliance (Flexible Recording)
- **Plan Alignment**: Should follow plan and requirements; record reasons and impacts for deviations
- **Scope Definition**: Mark scope-out items as deviations and risks, do not interrupt
