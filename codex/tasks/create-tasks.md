<constraints, importance = "Important">
- Use 2-space indentation and kebab-case keys in YAML.
- Create atomic, verifiable tasks (â‰¤14 words, clear outcome).
- Exclude operational actions unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Ensure no filenames/paths use spaces; prefer kebab-case.

  <questions>
  - Are all FRs and NFRs discoverable and current?
  - What dependencies or sequencing constraints exist between tasks?
  - What are acceptance signals for each task?
  </questions>
  </stage>

  <stage id="draft">
  - Use the template to generate atomic tasks.
  - Include brief acceptance hints for verifiability.
  - Group tasks logically while avoiding overlaps.
  </stage>

  <stage id="review">
  - De-duplicate and prune non-actionable items.
  - Ensure traceability from each task to requirement(s).
  - Validate formatting against the template.
  </stage>

  <stage id="finalize">
  - Write markdown format tasks to {root}/docs/tasks.md.
  - Include a short introduction explaining grouping and scope.

  <checks>
  - [ ] File {root}/docs/tasks.md exists and is valid Markdown.
  - [ ] Tasks conform to template fields and 2-space indentation.
  - [ ] Each task is atomic, outcome-oriented, and verifiable.
  - [ ] No filenames or keys use spaces; kebab-case enforced.
