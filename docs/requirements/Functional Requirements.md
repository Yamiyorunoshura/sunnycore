## Functional Requirements


### F-001: Contract Layer Testing
- **Title**: Structured Artifact Validation

  - Requirements artifacts must validate against requirements_schema.json
  - Architecture artifacts must validate against architecture_schema.json
  - All required fields must be present and correctly typed
  - Schema validation runs in <1 second per artifact
- **Business Rules**:
  - No artifact can proceed to next stage without passing contract validation
  - Schema errors must be machine-readable and actionable
- **Dependencies**: JSON Schema definitions, validation scripts
- **Effort Estimate**: M
- **Notes**: Focus on catching format errors early, not content quality

### F-002: Behavior Layer Testing

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Golden set must cover normal cases, edge cases, and error scenarios
  - Requirements coverage ≥95% against golden functional requirements
  - Un-testable statements ratio ≤5% (vague terms like "fast", "stable")
  - Architecture alignment F1 score ≥0.9 against requirements mapping
- **Business Rules**:
  - Golden sets must be version-controlled and reviewed
  - Metrics must be computed automatically in CI
- **Dependencies**: Golden datasets, evaluation scripts, metric definitions
- **Effort Estimate**: L
- **Notes**: Use LLM-as-judge for semantic comparison where rules are insufficient

### F-003: Robustness Layer Testing
- **Title**: Metamorphic Testing Suite
- **Description**: Automated input transformation testing to ensure output stability
- **Priority**: Medium
- **User Story**: As a system architect, I want to test that minor input variations don't break critical outputs so that I can ensure system reliability
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support synonym replacement transformations
  - Support paragraph reordering transformations
  - Support irrelevant content injection transformations
  - Key conclusion consistency ≥90% across transformations
- **Business Rules**:
  - Transformations must be semantically neutral
  - Critical design decisions must remain stable
- **Dependencies**: Transformation scripts, comparison algorithms
- **Effort Estimate**: M
- **Notes**: Focus on transformations that should NOT affect key decisions

### F-004: Security Layer Testing
- **Title**: OWASP LLM Security Testing
- **Description**: Automated red team testing with OWASP LLM Top-10 coverage
- **Priority**: High
- **User Story**: As a security engineer, I want automated injection testing so that I can ensure the system resists prompt attacks
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Cover OWASP LLM01 (Prompt Injection), LLM02 (Insecure Output Handling), LLM03 (Training Data Poisoning)
  - Attack success rate ≤1% for covered vulnerabilities
  - Include privilege escalation tests
  - Include system prompt leakage tests
- **Business Rules**:
  - Security tests must run in isolated environment
  - No actual system modifications during testing
- **Dependencies**: OWASP test suites, security test harness
- **Effort Estimate**: M
- **Notes**: Focus on defense against common attack patterns

### F-005: Retrieval Layer Testing
- **Title**: RAG Quality Evaluation
- **Description**: Separate evaluation of retrieval quality vs generation quality
- **Priority**: Medium
- **User Story**: As a RAG developer, I want to evaluate retrieval independently so that I can distinguish between retrieval and generation issues
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Top-k retrieval hit rate ≥85% for golden queries
  - Context relevance score ≥0.8 for retrieved chunks
  - Answer faithfulness score ≥0.9 relative to context
  - Retrieval latency <500ms for standard queries
- **Business Rules**:
  - Retrieval and generation metrics must be reported separately
  - Evaluation must use standardized datasets
- **Dependencies**: RAG evaluation tools, test datasets, embedding models
- **Effort Estimate**: M
- **Notes**: Use RAGAs or MLflow Evaluate for standardized metrics

### F-006: Tool Integration Framework
- **Title**: Testing Tool Ecosystem
- **Description**: Integrated testing tools with unified reporting and CI integration
- **Priority**: High
- **User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want integrated testing tools so that I can run all tests with a single command and get unified reports
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Promptfoo integration for A/B testing and LLM-as-judge
  - DeepEval integration for pytest-style assertions
  - RAGAs integration for retrieval evaluation
  - Unified test execution with single command
- **Business Rules**:
  - All tools must work together without conflicts
  - Reports must be mergeable and comparable
- **Dependencies**: Promptfoo, DeepEval, RAGAs, CI configuration
- **Effort Estimate**: L
- **Notes**: Focus on tool interoperability, not just individual tool usage

### F-007: CI/CD Integration
- **Title**: Automated Pipeline Gates
- **Description**: CI/CD pipeline integration with automated quality gates
- **Priority**: High
- **User Story**: As a release manager, I want automated quality gates so that I can prevent regressions and track quality over time
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - GitHub Actions workflow for PR validation
  - Automated pass/fail decisions based on thresholds
  - Diff reporting to identify regression sources
  - Quality dashboards with historical tracking
- **Business Rules**:
  - No manual intervention required for standard validation
  - Clear failure reasons with actionable feedback
- **Dependencies**: CI configuration, dashboard setup, reporting tools
- **Effort Estimate**: M
- **Notes**: Include traceability to identify which changes caused failures

### F-008: Test Data Management
- **Title**: Version-Controlled Test Assets
- **Description**: Comprehensive test data management with versioning and lifecycle
- **Priority**: Medium
- **User Story**: As a test engineer, I want version-controlled test data so that I can maintain test reliability and reproduce issues
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All test data version-controlled in git
  - Golden sets with clear versioning strategy
  - Test data update workflow with validation
  - Test data documentation and usage guidelines
- **Business Rules**:
  - Test data changes must go through review process
  - Historical test reproducibility must be maintained
- **Dependencies**: Git repositories, test data structure, review processes
- **Effort Estimate**: S
- **Notes**: Include automated test data validation
