## Project Info


- **Name**: Multi-Stage Spec-Coding Pipeline Testing Framework
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Description**: Automated testing system for requirements→architecture→outputs pipeline with structured validation layers
- **Background**: The spec-coding pipeline requires a practical, CI-ready testing framework that validates each stage's artifacts and ensures end-to-end reliability
- **Objectives**:
  - Implement contract-based validation for all pipeline artifacts
  - Establish golden set testing for behavior verification
  - Build metamorphic testing for robustness validation
  - Integrate security testing with OWASP LLM Top-10 coverage
  - Enable automated CI/CD integration with clear pass/fail gates
