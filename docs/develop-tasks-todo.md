## Task 5: 檢索測試層實現 (Retrieval Layer Testing Implementation)

### Stage 0: Setup
- [ ] Read all working steps and the TDD-based implementation plan from plan-tasks phase
- [ ] Create a todo list markdown file
- [ ] Extract acceptance criteria and test conditions defined in the implementation plan

### Stage 1: RED - Implement Tests
- [ ] Implement test cases for RAG Evaluation Framework (Task 5.1)
- [ ] Convert acceptance criteria into executable test code:
  - Top-k檢索命中率≥85% (precision@k ≥ 0.85)
  - 上下文相關性評分≥0.8 (relevance_score ≥ 0.8)
  - 答案忠誠度評分≥0.9 (faithfulness_score ≥ 0.9)
  - 檢索延遲<500ms (p95_latency < 500ms)
- [ ] Implement test cases for RAGAs Integration (Task 5.2)
- [ ] Ensure tests fail initially as expected (RED state)
- [ ] Validate test coverage matches the planned verification methods

### Stage 2: GREEN - Minimal Implementation
- [ ] Implement RAGEvaluator class architecture
- [ ] Implement GoldenDataset manager
- [ ] Develop metrics calculation engine (precision@k, relevance, faithfulness)
- [ ] Integrate performance monitoring and latency measurement
- [ ] Implement RAGAsIntegrator wrapper class
- [ ] Implement standardized test data conversion
- [ ] Develop separated quality report generator
- [ ] Follow the architectural mappings specified in the implementation plan
- [ ] Focus on making tests green with simplest possible solutions
- [ ] Implement both functional and non-functional requirements as planned

### Stage 3: REFACTOR - Optimize
- [ ] Refactor code while maintaining all tests green
- [ ] Apply optimizations and consolidations identified in the implementation plan
- [ ] Implement cross-cutting concerns as specified in the plan
- [ ] Enhance code quality without breaking test coverage
- [ ] Optimize performance targets (p95延遲<5000ms for full test suite)

### Stage 4: Validate and Document
- [ ] Validate final implementation against all acceptance criteria from the plan
- [ ] Ensure all planned test conditions are satisfied
- [ ] Generate development notes using the template
- [ ] Output documentation to docs/dev-notes/5-dev-notes.md
