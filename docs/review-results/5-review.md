## context

summary: Task 5 implements a comprehensive RAG evaluation framework with independent retrieval and generation quality assessment, exceeding all performance targets and demonstrating exceptional architectural compliance.

### scope_alignment

in_scope_covered: yes
justification: All planned components (RAGEvaluator, GoldenDataset, MetricsCalculator, RAGAsIntegrator, DataConverter, ReportGenerator) successfully implemented with full functionality
out_of_scope_changes:
- Added comprehensive security modules (input_validator.py, isolation_manager.py, security_test_engine.py)
- Extended test coverage to include security validation scenarios

## acceptance_decision
