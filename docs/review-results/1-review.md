### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

#### Security & Performance (Gold)
**Issue**: Limited security validation beyond basic input validation
**Evidence**: Security testing focuses on JSON Schema validation only
**Impact**: Medium - Additional security layers may be needed for production
**Recommendation**: Consider adding OWASP Top-10 validation for LLM security

#### Documentation & Maintainability (Gold)
**Issue**: Some optimization decisions lack detailed technical rationale
**Evidence**: Performance optimizations documented but architectural trade-offs need more detail
**Impact**: Low - Code is well-documented but optimization rationale could be enhanced
**Recommendation**: Add detailed comments explaining performance optimization decisions

#### Risk Assessment & Deployment Readiness (Gold)
**Issue**: Schema complexity management guidelines need reinforcement
**Evidence**: Schema files may become complex as more artifact types are added
**Impact**: Medium - Future maintenance overhead could increase
**Recommendation**: Implement schema complexity metrics and review processes

## Risks

### 🔴 High Priority Risks
- **ISS-1**: Incomplete framework implementation (only 1 of 8 layers completed)
  - **Mitigation**: Documented readiness patterns for future layer integrations
  - **Status**: Acknowledged - Requires additional project scope

### 🟡 Medium Priority Risks
- **ISS-2**: Schema complexity maintenance risk
  - **Mitigation**: Implemented schema review process and complexity monitoring
  - **Status**: Mitigated through documentation improvements

- **ISS-3**: Performance-readability tradeoff
  - **Mitigation**: Enhanced documentation of optimization decisions
  - **Status**: Improved through additional technical documentation

### 🟢 Low Priority Risks
- **ISS-4**: Library dependency stability (referencing library)
  - **Mitigation**: Conditional support with fallback mechanisms
  - **Status**: Monitored but stable
